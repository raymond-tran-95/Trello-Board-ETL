**WIP Process:**
A team member should have a maximum of two (2) items in their WIP queue at any one time. If an item is blocked due to an outstanding question or action required from another team or team member etc. the card should be moved to the 'Blocked / Waiting on McD' queue.

When (and only when) a team member has less than two (2) current items in their WIP queue they should move the top card from the 'To Do/Prioritised Backlog' queue into their 'WIP' queue and commence working on the new task.

Notes:

- There may be times when the top card in the 'To Do/Prioritised Backlog' queue into their 'WIP' queue is assigned to an individual team member, which will be known as a team member will be added to the card. In this case take the next card in the list to work on.

- If an item in the 'Blocked / Waiting on McD' queue becomes unblocked and the team member that was working on the item already has two (2) current items in their WIP queue the card should be moved to the top of the 'To Do/Prioritised Backlog' queue.",5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80a6f6

- How work/cards are allocated, some people getting more cards than others
- Cards sat in testing for too long, peer review cards
- raymond did majority of the review near the end of the sprint

- How we allocate cards for each sprint
- Should allocate cards based on capacity and domain
- Know the total capacity of the team in the sprint planning
- Review of cards should take top priority
- Separate board for Monopoly
- theres a sheet of learnings from last year's monopoly

- review last year's technical problems to ensure it doesn't happen again this year @piyushrastogi4 to share that document with the team
- Let the team select the cards on their backlog based on their capacity
- Label the cards by domain and domain squads (campaign & Platform)
- If one of the squads is overloaded, the other team can assist if needed
- (5 x 10) x 2 = 100. 50% on Monopoly = 50 points per sprint. 80% capacity = 40 points

Hi CapGem Team!

I met a couple of you on some calls last week - but as way of introduction I have joined the McDonalds account from Digitas as a Data Strategist working primarily Cali (who you all know) and Bri (who replaced Simon as the data analyst).

As part of the ongoing test and optimisation cycle we have identified the need to do some analysis on Monopoly and establish some recommendations for optimising the comms.

In order to complete this work we need access to some additional data which we currently do not receive. Can you please review the data request below and then we can setup a meeting to discuss what additional information or briefing you require.  

We have planned to commence the analysis work next week w/c 21/9 - let me know what we can achieve.

33,5f2792cdb1010d48babbb898,Upload P8 Auth key for Mobilepush Apps,"Action Required: Upload MobilePush Auth Key for iOS Sends
Apple is requiring all mobile vendors to migrate their processes to support their new updated push notification service later this year. As part of this migration, Marketing Cloud MobilePush will remove support for current .p12 APNs certificates and will require all iOS customers to use .p8 Auth Keys to send push notifications. In preparation for this change, MobilePush is allowing customers to upload a .p8 Auth Key for each of their apps in MobilePush Administration or in Setup. You will be able to update your Auth Key after the June Marketing Cloud release.

When:

Once the June release has pushed and your instance is provisioned, you can upload and save your .p8 Auth Keys within MobilePush Administration. All iOS sends continues to use the legacy .p12 certificates.
In a later Marketing Cloud release, which is estimated late July or early August, you are required to upload and save your .p8 Auth Keys to send iOS push notifications. MobilePush will remove support for .p12 Certificates and require that all iOS sends use .p8 Auth Keys.
Who: This action applies to MobilePush customers who are sending messages to iOS devices. No code changes are required to your app or to the MobilePush SDK. No action is required for Android.

How: In Setup or in MobilePush Administration, navigate to your application and upload your app’s .p8 Auth Key.

As discussed earlier please see below initial discussions regarding a potential Spotify partnership giving us access to premium codes.
Are you able to look through the below and let me know any initial questions/watch outs. I am assuming we would use a similar approach to Monopoly 2 years ago to distribute unique codes – however this may potentially be unique URLs.

Hi Tobi

It probably makes sense to break things out into two separate parts (tech and commercial). We need to make sure we go through the tech checklist before we lock up the commercials - just to make sure we haven't missed anything.

For tech, I've tried to keep it as clear and on point as possible:
•	I've attached a fairly generic PDF explaining the trial codes mechanic (we call them PPT or Premium Partner Trials)
o	A quick clarification. In the attached it says that people who have tried premium before wouldn’t be eligible. 
	My understanding based on previous calls are that anyone without premium is eligible – meaning that if you had tried previously you could still activate premium via these codes? I would expect the majority of your existing base would have tried a free trial before so would be a significant decrease in relevance from an activation POV as most Spotify users wouldn’t qualify? 
•	Prior to launch, Spotify will issue you with a CSV of unique trial codes. Typically sent via SFTP. You'll need a secure method of storing them (such as an S3 bucket or similar)
o	We currently use our salesforce marketing cloud SFTP for file transfers so likely we will use this.
o	Will these be encrypted?
•	Code Volume: we can probably issue up to 5m in the first tranche and can quickly generate more if required. 
o	Excellent – this will definitely help us better allocate in real time and likely cover our needs for a monthly campaign based on send to individual customer.
•	Code Expiry: the codes will auto-expire 1m from the end of the campaign period (the customer will see an error page explaining this if they try it).
•	You will need to ensure a mechanic of delivery of a unique code to a unique customer, following their agreed purchase behaviour (assuming via email, and only one per customer during the campaign as per our chat).
•	Code example: 
o	Is the expectation that each email receives a unique URL? Or a code in dynamic text? Is the benefit of using the link that the code is autopopulated on the landing page?
•	Spotify will set up a URL for the co-branded landing page of the campaign (URL to be agreed). The landing page will also need some copy and a logo - we'll share exact asset spec closer to the time.
•	The customer will continue through the landing page flow, creating a new account or connecting to an existing account, go through an eligibility check (to see if they are eligible for the offer, ie, they haven't had a premium offer before or are they currently on premium), enter their credit card details for auto-payment after the trial expires.
•	Ts&Cs - we will share specific Ts & Cs for the landing page too. 
•	iOS specific: Promotion of any offer within an iOS app must fall within app store guidelines. This is up to you to ensure it meets guidelines as it is your app and we can't interpret the guidelines on your behalf unfortunately. Happy to talk through further details on this one if needed.   
•	Spotify will share a monthly report with you, which include the date a code was 'consumed' (ie, redeemed). We will not share personal data and it is up to you to link the 'consumption' of a code back to the original consumer you sent it to. We can't guarantee it was the person that you sent it to who actually redeemed (it is always possible they shared with a friend and did not redeem it themselves, but we assume this will only be an edge case). Once a code is redeemed, it cannot be re-used.
o	I assume this will be shared to the same SFTP?
Can you take a look through and confirm all of the above is do-able? Just reply in line or call me directly (0422 139334) if anything is unclear.

I'll respond separately on the key points we'll need to put in place for the agreement to go through (dates, consumer journey, marketing channels, etc).

Really looking forward to working on this with you.

Cheers,

Mark

Tim has nominated Lex cc’d from his team to work through potential options for the mechanic and how this may fit into the current plan. One of the pieces being potentially linking this to the existing 30D30D promotion where we see a peak in McDonald’s app usage (c.700k daily active users).
Maddy & I will contuinue to support from a digital and data POV however at this stage we are looking to better define how we can accommodate this within the plan.

39,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80a736,Bluedot Implementation for GMA,"Hi all,

With the Salesforce SDK now in place in GMA we're keen to move onto implementing the Bluedot SDK. 

Katie, for reference I've attached the initial doc that was pulled together last year on Bluedot (from slide 12). 

To recap there will be a requirement to test the impact on battery drain once we have implemented the staging app. Based on previous findings from a POC carried out in Jan 2018 the Bluedot SDK had a negative impact on battery drain particularly on Android devices. The Bluedot team have since made improvements to the SDK however these will need to be validated before deploying to prod. 

How we test the above will need to be worked through with the wider CapGem team (Gareth) and Steria. 

Bluedot have supplied the below documentation:

Our developer homepage: https://docs.bluedot.io/
Specifically SFMC Integration: https://docs.bluedot.io/salesforce-integration/
Configuration Options and Best Practices Guide https://www.dropbox.com/s/jsgvk1p98sm6w9m/Configuration%20options%20and%20best%20practices%20guide.pdf?dl=0
Given that iOS app publishing can be trickier than Android, we have this iOS Publishing Guide
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ppjx6rnw5z5l6b2/iOS%20Publishing%20Guide%20%281%29.pdf?dl=0

Please can you review the above documentation and let me know if you have any questions on this/additions before I raise a new JIRA ticket?

Thanks

40,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80ab04,Password reset email from CIM to SFMC,"Hi Mark,

 

As mentioned on this week’s WIP,  conversations have started to pick-up again on transitioning reset password emails from CIM (ACC).  As Australia is yet to move over to ACS,  the view is to see if it is feasible to transition the password reset email functionality over to Salesforce.

 

The following IDEA ticket has been logged to facilitate this request. https://us-jira.mcd.com/browse/IDEA-1808

 

On this ticket we have asked for support from Global by way of:

·         Sharing Documentation

·         Knowledge Transfer Sessions

·         Access to capability leads

·         Access to development systems to allow assessment, review and POC of solution.

 

The following screenshot and confluence link has been shared overnight to klick off this info sharing.

https://us-confluence.mcd.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=AT&title=Account+Transformation+-+DCS+2.0+Event+Directory#AccountTransformation-DCS2.0EventDirectory-EventstoCIM

 

I think the question we’d like answered is as follows:  Can the password reset email be transitioned to Salesforce?  If so, how?

 

Can you please review the above and share your thoughts, queries or feedback you may have in the meantime?  Also,  please put forward the approach you’d take including which resource you’d leverage to progress this requirement and timings given the current priorities and work load?

 

Thanks

42,6024cb78f367f562d4844dfc,Propensity - change files received from SAS to Serum.,"Hi Team,

After my catch up with the Serum team today I now have a clearer idea on the objectives and likely impact to SFMC for the requirement to transition propensity files.

The broad objective is to transition the way propensity files are delivered to SFMC.  It is currently from Annalect to SFMC,  in the future it will be Serum > SFMC instead.

The objective of the Serum team is to replicate the exact file format & structure that Annalect delivers today.

Based on this approach there will be minimal impact to SFMC,  the minimal change would be a different location to pick-up the propensity files from.

@Ravi,  can you update the TRELLO card accordingly?   

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks

Regards,
Renato

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Team,

As discussed on our Salesforce WIP the plan is to eventually transition the way propensity files are sent to SFMC from current Annalect > SFMC and transition to Serum > SFMC instead.

Find below the schema of the Serum output files would look on the bottom of this confluence page: https://us-confluence.mcd.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=Analytics&title=Serum+To+ACS+Details.  

Can you review in preparation and flag any feedback with me ahead of us touching base with global on connecting Serum to Salesforce.

Thanks for joining call earlier. 

 

Some notes I took from AU side:

 

The main ask I gathered was for what would be the effort/feasibility to import profile data using the same format and transport mechanism that SFMC uses today to send unsubs to CCP

 

Sample profile data in the email I forwarded is MCD_CustBatch_US_PRD_2020-08-31_110733_28_UBEREATS.dat



 

 

There were other items that need further discussion pending prioritisation:

 

·         Storing UE and DD customer profile data on SFMC

·         Handling net new customers that don’t have DCSID on SFMC

·         Handling unsubscribes (subscription centre) on SFMC

·         Handling opt-out from data sharing from file above on SFMC

·         Capturing Delivery data on SFMC

·         What delivery email requirements are for SFMC

 

Other non tech requiring further discussion:

 

·         Priority

·         ACS

 

Let’s add to SF WIP agenda,  if additional separate discussion required then that can happen too.

 

Thanks

As discussed we we have been given a brief to look at how we might be able to give customers some free tickets to A-league games.

 

There will be

 

One option that we were keen to investigate was a post transaction email journey that would distribute email codes but only after first interacting with an email.

 

What we were looking at would be:

Pre-campaign:

1.      Marketing team to also provide  a list of ticket codes with the associated club redeemable at 1 of 9 catchments areas

a.      Each ticket code would be redeemable for only one catchment area

2.      Marketing team to provide a list of relevant stores for each of the 9 catchment areas where the relevant ticket would be available.

3.      Cap Gem to set up relevant data structure within SF to access ticket eligibility by store

4.      Digitas to create dynamic email template to inc. dynamic ticket code, club imagery & associated copy

 

During campaign

5.      Customer spends over $10 at a specific range of stores at a restaurant.

6.      Customers are identified in salesforce and email is sent to all customers that qualify

a.      Email to contain the relevant information for the game they are eligible to receive a ticket from based on the store they purchased from

7.      Customer receives email, and interacts in some way (eg. Button click) to show intent that they would use it/interested

8.      Upon clicking the button an auto response email is generated based on the following codes:

a.      Customer is one of the 1st x number of people to respond

                                                    i.     Email contains the code for customers to redeem their ticket

b.      Customer interacts after ticket codes have been given away

                                                    i.     Sorry email send without a ticketing codes

 

Would you be able to please let us know in the first instance if this is feasible so we can let the internal business processes progress? From there we would need to better understand timings etc on estimated live date.

 

Thanks!

Hi Mark,

 

We will need a new feed to support an new solution called OIT that will be leveraged for scheduling offer campaigns in the future.

 

The feed is called the Salesforce Segment files and will be sent to the TMS SFTP.   

 

The file will include GroupID and GroupName

 

OIT will use this as reference,  so that in Audience set-up OIT will only show valid GroupID/GroupName pairs.

 

Please add to trello and add to discussion for next Salesforce WIP

 

Thanks

Hi Team,


Here are some notes that we can review to expedite conversation.

 

 

OIT – Offers Input Tool

A platform that will allow marketers like Airi to create and schedule Offers campaign ahead of time.  Days, weeks, months ahead of time.

 

 

Salesforce Requirement.  Produce a Segment File

·         Salesforce Segment files from SFTP.

·         Files to include Group ID and Group name

 

 

Filename

OCE_SalesforceSegmentFile_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.CSV

 

File Format

Group_ID, Group_Name

8005,$1 Hash Brown

8015, $2 Cheeseburger

 

Schedule/Frequency

Adhoc – whenever new and/or update

 

Send to

SFTP Server

 

Notes

·         Needs to be sent ahead of campaign being created/published

·         Create a range of GroupID, GroupName for adhoc purpose

 

 

 

The above will unlock the following on OIT

 

·         Check for OCE_SalesforceSegmentFile_*.CSV every hour

·         Process when new OCE_SalesforceSegmentFile_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.CSV is found

 

 

·         On OIT for audience set-up

·         Display list of all Salesforce  Group ID and Group Name

69,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80aad2,CRDS segment count file,"As part of achieving parity with R4 there is a requirement by the market to see the final segment counts to validate the count before deploying the offer. The final segment count is the number of ECPID records that are assigned to a specific offer id & name.

In R4 a method by which this is done is by CIM sending a file through FTP to Salesforce Marketing Cloud which has all ECPID ids and their associated Segment/offer ID. Salesforce then validates which records exist and can be deployed to in order to determine if a push notification or email should be sent to them.

We would like this same functionality to be done in R6 with a file from CRDS sent through FTP to Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Preferably this segment count file is sent after a file sent from c360 is imported and processed in CRDS. Allowing validation that records sent from c360 have correctly added and removed records in CRDS.

The file from CRDS should have at a minimum the following fields –
 * ECPID
 * Segment ID (Please note, this segment ID field refers to the offer id field sent from Salesforce Marketing Cloud and refers to the id of a type of offer for example: $2 Big Mac)
 * Segment Name

71,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80a9fe,SF Adapter,"**Introduction**
===============================
This purpose of this card is to capture the work required for the Salesforce Adapter piece in Release 6. 

**Background**
----------------
The upstream systems and micro-services are undergoing changes that require us to ensure parity with the functionality of Release 4. One of the major changes that is taking place in R6 is the replacement of the message queuing service that subscribes to events published by the Digital Customer Service (DCS). RabbitMQ is being replaced by Amazon Simple Queuing Service to allow for scalibility, performance, and up-time SLA's. 

**Release 6**
----------------
The Salesforce Adapter (Mulesoft) is the integration layer between Amazon SQS and Salesforce Service Cloud. Mulesoft will be absorbing any upstream architectural changes, and will maintain parity with R4 within the integration with Salesforce Service Cloud. This means that Mulesoft will still be batching the integrations in chunks of 200 maximum, and merging customer records if they are present in the same batch. 

**Canary Release**
----------------
For the canary release to be successful, Salesforce Service Cloud will have to receive API calls from the R4 stack in combination with the R6 stack. This means that the API limit of Salesforce would have to be increased to accommodate the increased API calls.

**Bulk Testing**
----------------
To ensure parity with R4, the ability for the newly implemented systems to handle high load transactions needs to be tested alongside the ability for Mulesoft and Salesforce to be able to consume the bulk updates.

**Links & Documents**

Afternoon Mark

 

Regarding the reporting piece. The ultimate goal is to be able to identify for each email/push/inApp message that someone receives what was the content that was served to them. As customer move through the process it becomes difficult to work out at a particular point in time what they were eligible for etc

 

Some emails have the ‘if eligible’ modules and Phase 4 – the dynamic hero will be dependent on the customers segment. I need to be able to say for example:

Customer A during Phase 4, they were ‘Regular’ so the Hero Module was ‘X’, they also got modules 1,3 & 5

                But the following week they may have moved to ‘Super’ so the hero module will change and potentially so will the other modules

Ultimately for every email that gets sent to each customer, we need a log of what impression(s) that email contained.

 

This will enable us to understand the impact of different modules

 

Does that make sense? 

 

Happy to jump on a call if it’s easier

Custom meta data (per zone)

            -           storeZoneIndex (this is used to control what zones are active/inactive via app config)

            -           outerZoneId (for inner zones this would have a reference to the ID of the outer zone this is paired with. For outer zones this would be excluded)

            -           innerZoneID (for outer zones this would have a reference to the ID of the inner zone this is paired with. For inner zones this would be excluded)

            -           storeId (the ID of the store this zone relates to - this is not necessary for the mechanic to work, but we feel this may be useful from a reporting -           perspective)

            -           *zoneType (“Outer”/“Inner”)

 

Generic meta data

            -           *deviceID (the firebase Anonymous Auth ID assigned to this user - Salesforce will need to use this for salting allocated codes)

 

The items marked with * are the ones Salesforce will need to be concerned with, the others will be used by the app only. The items marked with * should be used as follows:

 

ZoneType - Salesforce should filter events based on the ZoneType. Any “Outer” zone events should trigger a Journey to allocate a code to the user. “Inner” zone events can be ignored as they will be handled in the app.

 

deviceID - This is one of the items that is used to Salt the allocated code for a user.

 

Code Allocation

 

There will be three sets of codes that users can be allocated:

 

Codes that provide the user with a chance card
Codes that provide the user with a 1 currency token
Codes that provide the user with a 5 currency token
 

Initially there should be a random split between allocation of chance card codes and 1 currency token codes (split % to be confirmed). At a later time we may need to change the journey to give out 5 currency tokens instead.

 

Note that users can only trigger a zone once a day. The first time a user triggers a zone entry event they should be allocated a code and this should be sent through to the Zone DB. Subsequent entry events for the same user and zone on the same calendar date (AEST) just resend the code that was initially allocated.

 

Record check in endpoint

 

Once a code has been allocated Salesforce will need to salt this using the algorithm previously provided and then pass the details on to the Zone DB.

 

The endpoint URL will be provided, but the data that needs to be passed through is:

 

User ID - This will be the ID allocated to the user by Firebase Anonymous Authentication.

Zone ID - The ID of the zone the user has entered

Code - The encrypted and hashed code that the user can redeem in iWin on playing the AR experience in this zone

IWin ID - The ID this user is mapped to in the iWin system

 

Zone exit events

 

When Salesforce receives a zone exit event for an “Outer” zone this will also need to be passed through to the Zone DB. The data to be passed to this endpoint should be:

 

User ID - This will be the ID allocated to the user by Firebase Anonymous Authentication.

Zone ID - The ID of the zone the user has entered

IWin ID - The ID this user is mapped to in the iWin system

 

 

Cleanup

 

At the end of each day the Zone DB will provide a list of salted codes that were not used and can be reclaimed by Salesforce. The Zone DB will drop these into an FTP location and this should then trigger a journey to reverse the allocated process and make these codes available for use once more.

 

Note: Please provide the FTP details for the location where this file will need to be stored, and any specific format requirements.

Hi Guys,


Setting up an initial chat amongst ourselves to discuss a new integration requirement to Salesforce currently in the works.   

 

The immediate thought is to leverage for Monopoly,  in allowing Salesforce to get GMA MOAP transactions in near real time via Cybersource REST API.  

 

Allowing us to unlock a more timely way to incentivise GMA MOAP purchases during Monopoly.

 

Cybersource have included links to documentation below.   They have a REST API service that allows for pulling of transaction details on-demand, real-time.    

 

·         More information can be found here.  The API reference has the payload information in the response section so you can get an understanding what information is passed back that may be of use to your purpose.   

 

·         The dev guide specific to this service is here.

 

SDK is also available on Github along with sample codes to help get you started on the PoC.  The link can be access via the main CyberSource Developer portal (developer.cybersource.com).

Hi Tobi

It probably makes sense to break things out into two separate parts (tech and commercial). We need to make sure we go through the tech checklist before we lock up the commercials - just to make sure we haven't missed anything.

For tech, I've tried to keep it as clear and on point as possible:
•	I've attached a fairly generic PDF explaining the trial codes mechanic (we call them PPT or Premium Partner Trials)
o	A quick clarification. In the attached it says that people who have tried premium before wouldn’t be eligible. 
	My understanding based on previous calls are that anyone without premium is eligible – meaning that if you had tried previously you could still activate premium via these codes? I would expect the majority of your existing base would have tried a free trial before so would be a significant decrease in relevance from an activation POV as most Spotify users wouldn’t qualify? 
•	Prior to launch, Spotify will issue you with a CSV of unique trial codes. Typically sent via SFTP. You'll need a secure method of storing them (such as an S3 bucket or similar)
o	We currently use our salesforce marketing cloud SFTP for file transfers so likely we will use this.
o	Will these be encrypted?
•	Code Volume: we can probably issue up to 5m in the first tranche and can quickly generate more if required. 
o	Excellent – this will definitely help us better allocate in real time and likely cover our needs for a monthly campaign based on send to individual customer.
•	Code Expiry: the codes will auto-expire 1m from the end of the campaign period (the customer will see an error page explaining this if they try it).
•	You will need to ensure a mechanic of delivery of a unique code to a unique customer, following their agreed purchase behaviour (assuming via email, and only one per customer during the campaign as per our chat).
•	Code example: 
o	Is the expectation that each email receives a unique URL? Or a code in dynamic text? Is the benefit of using the link that the code is autopopulated on the landing page?
•	Spotify will set up a URL for the co-branded landing page of the campaign (URL to be agreed). The landing page will also need some copy and a logo - we'll share exact asset spec closer to the time.
•	The customer will continue through the landing page flow, creating a new account or connecting to an existing account, go through an eligibility check (to see if they are eligible for the offer, ie, they haven't had a premium offer before or are they currently on premium), enter their credit card details for auto-payment after the trial expires.
•	Ts&Cs - we will share specific Ts & Cs for the landing page too. 
•	iOS specific: Promotion of any offer within an iOS app must fall within app store guidelines. This is up to you to ensure it meets guidelines as it is your app and we can't interpret the guidelines on your behalf unfortunately. Happy to talk through further details on this one if needed.   
•	Spotify will share a monthly report with you, which include the date a code was 'consumed' (ie, redeemed). We will not share personal data and it is up to you to link the 'consumption' of a code back to the original consumer you sent it to. We can't guarantee it was the person that you sent it to who actually redeemed (it is always possible they shared with a friend and did not redeem it themselves, but we assume this will only be an edge case). Once a code is redeemed, it cannot be re-used.
o	I assume this will be shared to the same SFTP?
Can you take a look through and confirm all of the above is do-able? Just reply in line or call me directly (0422 139334) if anything is unclear.

I'll respond separately on the key points we'll need to put in place for the agreement to go through (dates, consumer journey, marketing channels, etc).

Really looking forward to working on this with you.

Cheers,

Hi all,
 
Just following onto our catch up last week.
 
We are still discussing where it may be relevant to incorporate this activity into our plan.
 
Tim has nominated Lex cc’d from his team to work through potential options for the mechanic and how this may fit into the current plan. One of the pieces being potentially linking this to the existing 30D30D promotion where we see a peak in McDonald’s app usage (c.700k daily active users).
Maddy & I will contuinue to support from a digital and data POV however at this stage we are looking to better define how we can accommodate this within the plan.
 
If you please let us know who would be best for Lex to start discussing this with.

115,607e2f92e5c8956a8a54031f,Pipeline Requirement - Securely Ingesting records from 3rd party ORGS,"Hi Team,


See below email thread relating to a pipeline requirement.   

 

The requirement is to build an ability ingest records from 3rd party organisations and ingest to SFMC.

 

From a technical perspective, the basic needs are:

Establish data transfer approach – ideally this would be a standardised approach that would any other clubs/3rd parties could take advantage of
Establish the data structure required within Mcdonald’s CRM platforms to facilitate this use of data.
Creation of any bespoke assets to those particular customers.
 

Other Initial thoughts/considerations:

·         “GMA False” has been mentioned as a possible way forward.  What is “GMA False”?  Would this be suitable starting point?

·         Records will not have a McDonald’s ID (DCSID/ECPID/HashedDCSID)

·         Capture records source and date/time (e.g. Richmond FC)

·         3rd party T&C’s and privacy statement.  (legal requirements)

·         Handling records where record exists in DCS also.

·         Secure handling of data due to PII.

·         Handling unsubscribe,  Opt-out and request to be forgotten

·         Requirement to feeding Global platform – e.g.  CCP Requirements

·         McDonald’s Local/Global Policy on PII data transfer and ingestion.

 

This is an approach that we’ve not supported previously due to MMC integration.  Have a bit of a think through and try to come back with a potential way forward,  concerns,  watch-outs, etc.   


This requirement is at its early stages and awaiting prioritisation. So this is early notice for our team to work through this upcoming requirement.

 

@Ravi,  please add this to the SF agenda WIP items.

Great to hear from you again, and I can confirm that when reviewed a recent sampling of your Mobile Push sends jobs on our back end systems, I am seeing the following details:

--263,779 rows returned with ''MismatchSenderID' pushjobid = '0DAC2C0E-14ED-453E-AFCD-91D45E89D87E'
--264,630 rows returned with ''MismatchSenderID' pushjobid = '3BA46D17-7A4C-4AA4-9892-94EF3DBE9A81'

--263,130 rows returned with ''MismatchSenderID' pushjobid = 'DC344889-F9AE-47F0-990C-D5A757E070D1'

Our internal team had previously advised that in situations similar to this, we recommend that customers need only release a new version of their application. The SDK's Device Registration process includes your Application Version Code (must be incremented to release a new version of an application into Google's Play Store) in the Device Contact Model, and an updated registration will be sent to Marketing Cloud automatically. 

Would you be able advise this action was already performed?

It does not appear as if the number is growing - but in situations where it is increasing, that would mean that you have misaligned the ""sender ID"" that you are providing to the SDK, and the ""API Key"" that you are providing the Marketing Cloud servers.

See http://salesforce-marketingcloud.github.io/JB4A-SDK-Android/trouble-shooting/trouble-shooting-push-setup.html#send-a-test-push

124,6052a35199cab171a4ccd4d9,Switching from offer name to offer ID,"Hi All, 

Picking up a piece that Alice previously worked on  around a need to move from keying off Offer Name to keying off Offer ID across emails.

From my understanding keying offer ID is a much cleaner process, as the offer names can often be sixty or so characters.
Offer names can also have variables like an apostrophes which can mean that they easily can then not match up to what we have keyed in. 

In terms of email changes, we would need to make changes to the weekly newsletter and Monopoly Momentum email as they both use offer name for reference.
The McCafe OB email already uses offer ID so this will not need to be changed. 

Our team has estimated that the work for the changes would be 3 hours per email, 2 hours to make the change and 1 hour to test it. 

In regards to DE’s to update,  we have mainly been using MCV - Audiences, which contains offer_name AND offerID, so there is nothing to update there.  However please note that the  rest of the DE's below  should still be updated.

Any DE Type that is standard have to be done on your end (as they need to be done in the upstream automations) 
The filtered DEs can be done by either of us, we have estimated on our end filtered DE changes are is roughly 15 minutes to 30 minutes per change, would you confirm the timing if you changed these on your end? 

Please let me know if this is something you could assist with,

Hi Team,

 

Please see details below for the Monopoly acquisition offer requirements – as discussed with some of you it’s come to light the welcome offer is not a feasible solution (Initially discussed using welcome offer but because of the blanket offer opt in this won’t work).

 

Who: Monopoly TRUE, GMA FALSE customers

What: Award customers who are Monopoly TRUE but GMA FALSE with an offer when they download the mymaccas app.

Why: Advertise the offer in comms and Monopoly app as a GMA acquisition tactic throughout the campaign.

How: Instead we’re proposing a daily segment of new customers who were Monopoly TRUE, GMA FALSE and have downloaded the mymacca’s app (they are now Monopoly TRUE, GMA TRUE).

 

Questions:

Do Annalect/Cap see any issues with this?
Is this segment best created Annalect side or Cap side?
What is the biggest delay in a customer downloading and receiving the offer?
 

Please come back with initial thoughts and suggestions, happy to get a call in to discuss if required.

 

Thanks,

Hello,

The reason why we were asking for access in Salesforce was because of the following bug:  https://us-jira.mcd.com/browse/AUDG-4911

The in - app messaging functionality in iOS and Android, which leverages deep links from sales force, is not working.  So if there was deep link that was intended to navigate to order’s page, it would not navigate there. 

As part of the GMAUX core team’s attempt to first analyze the root cause and eventually fix it, we would need to be generating URL’s in salesforce to send via in – app messaging and observe what is actually going on in the code.   Hope this helps, please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

The AU team have prepared the following AU run sheet (see table below) based on the planned activities you shared earlier.   Can you and the relevant teams please review and feedback?  

The approach aims to validate that the e2e process for external segmentation is functioning on Saturday (Sydney time) and a day before the CRITICAL external segmentation automations run on Sunday evening (Sydney time).  

The BAU external segmentation automation that runs on Sunday evening (Sydney time) is CRITICAL to the AU market and will cause significant impact if it FAILS,  having this measure in place helps minimise the risk to that critical function. We appreciate your support in ensuring that the e2e process occurs and any issues identified be supported by the relevant teams with CRITICAL priority.

Please note that the E2E process involves SFMC / GoAnywhere / s3 buckets / lambda functions / C360 / CRDS are functioning also.   NB: Items highlighted in yellow are global managed platforms,  items in green are AU managed.  

Can you also please advise who the main points of contact at Global for any technical issues or McDonald’s executive escalations?

At this stage,   I’ve only got you and Maharshi

Further to Galatea’s request, I also wanted to check something. We are planning to send a reminder push to customers who haven’t redeemed the offer by end of the week but would like to test which day of the week performs best, either Thursday or Saturday. So we are thinking about splitting the audience who haven’t redeemed the offer so 50% receives the reminder push on Thursday and the other 50% receives it on Saturday. We would do this test this week and next. Then we would like to see results in terms of redemption and transactions on week 3 to decide whether we should deploy it on Thursday or Saturday for week 3 and 4.

Is this something you could help us with? Let me know if I can give you a call.

Thanks,

Hi all,

 We are looking at sending weekly reminder pushes and having targeted modules in the newsletter for customers that haven't redeemed the February weekly offer, is it possible to get a column added into the DE to identify customers who have redeemed these weekly offer ID's?

The offer ID for this week's offer is : 156210

We would need this to be added in today, however we are conscious that you usually need two days to do this.

Can you please let me know if this is possible or if you have any questions? 

Many thanks,

What stats do you have on SFMC regarding our email user base?  Do you have eMail client(Native Apple Mail/Outlook),  mobile platform (IOS / Android)?

 

The MUAT team are testing a GMA deep link feature and we seem to have issues with:

 

1.       Clicking on deep link on Android device

2.       Clicking on deep link on Gmail APP in IOS

 

Looking to see if the email stats on SFMC can give a view of the potential impact of this issue on our current user base.

 

Thanks

As the Push is being sent directly from mymacca’s to opted-in customers only we don’t feel there’s a specific risk of it being perceived a spam. That being said, we’ll be happy to use Rich Push with the Summer Cash Giveaway logo so it’s extra clear what the Push relates to.

Based on Tim’s email, if we are able to roll up customers with multiple entries in the DE so that they only receive 1 eDM a day with the number of entries they have that day called out, that would be great.

E.g. if someone has made 5 eligible transactions in 1 day, this would appear as 1 record in the DE and we would use this as a field in the email as per the below:
‘You have received <X> entries into the draw

Hi Kalpana and Raymond,

Thanks for your time today. Apologies on the late notice on the Entry eDM details – that was my fault. Please let me know what’s possible for Thurs.

Please can we have the following for McCafe Promo 2021:

-	Entry eDM
o	To be set up as a journey to deploy each day throughout the promo to customers that have bought a qualifying coffee purchase the day prior
o	To deploy each day at 12.30pm after transaction data has run
o	eDM to run from 11 Feb – 24 March (day after campaign start until the day after campaign ends to ensure we capture everybody that makes a eligible transaction over the promo period)
o	Please include Marketing Opt in and MCV Contactable flags – we only want to deploy to customers that are both Marketing opt in and MCV Contactable as this will be a marketing email
o	Is there a possibility to have a data point that tells us how many times someone made an eligible transaction in that day? Upon further discussion, it’d be great to have a variable in the data that says ‘You have received <X> entries into the draw’. Rach is just checking with Tim if each eligible transaction in 1 day counts as an entry. Will confirm but let us know if possible to include


-	Winners eDM
o	To start send from 15th March
o	Use same process as last year where Cap add winners to a DE 
o	This year we are only sending an eDM (no push). We do not need to worry about opt-ins as this will be a service message

Please have a look through and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Hey Piyush & team,
 
Hope you’re all well.
 
I’ve been informed that within the Salesforce DMP, if a user’s record does not change for 90 days, it is removed from the system entirely.
 
This means that although we are updating some customer flags each week with the files being sent across, customers that don’t change at all become forgotten after 3~ months.
 
Moving forward, we’ll need to do a quarterly refresh of the entire data set, exactly like the files used to begin this process.
 
@Piyush – Are you able to provide the master file broken out into 2 files  for the most recent date?
@Khalid – Would you mind uploading this to the DMP?

Having had a chat with Tobi about this.

 

We’d like to understand the following,  what would be the impact of adding subscription ID 24,25 and Hashed DCSID to the customer record. 

·         To help us understand, please provide estimates for the following:

§  As is Customer record data storage space needed before adding fields

§  Customer record data storage  space after adding fields

§  Customer record base of ~11,868,000 uses how much storage today?  (NB: The email thread below states that McDonald’s is using 47.4 Gb of space in Service Cloud.  However, what’s not clear if that is all to do with the ~11,868,000 customer records)

§  Customer record base of ~11,868,000 will require how much storage space after adding fields?

§  How much storage space will be required for 1 million customer records in service cloud (after subscription ID 24,25 and Hashed DCSID fields are added)?

We have built week 1 and it is with Airi for approval. Weeks 2 – 4 will hopefully be built by end of next week.

Questions for you:
-	For weeks 2 – 4 is it possible to schedule these to be switched if they are all approved?
-	Are you able to switch the eDM in the journey on Monday with the new version of Welcome 

It is a public holiday on Monday for NZ so hoping to sort everything today from an approvals perspective.

Any issues or questions, pls let me know.

Thanks,

We can not schedule the update of the emails and so we need to do that manually every Monday.

Hi Maddy,

Yes that’s fine. For the weekend cycle, it would be the file we deliver on 17th March that is pushed to customers on 19th March.
We will prep the customer of list of 20k this week so we can align with capgem/digitas on logistics. Most likely it will be similar to the daily/other day test last year where we excluded the customers from the normal propensity file and just supplied the list of users over email to capgem/digitas.

Hi Shwetha,
 
Please do not drop the file on Thursday instead  of Friday in the same folder (/Import/SAS/GMA_OFFERS), as it will overwrite the data before the comms go out on Friday.

--------------------------------------------------------
Hi all,

Based on Tim’s email, if we are able to roll up customers with multiple entries in the DE so that they only receive 1 eDM a day with the number of entries they have that day called out, that would be great.

E.g. if someone has made 5 eligible transactions in 1 day, this would appear as 1 record in the DE and we would use this as a field in the email as per the below:
‘You have received <X> entries into the draw

Let me know if possible 😊

Subject: McCafe Promo Requirements - Entry and Winners eDMs

Hi Kalpana and Raymond,

Thanks for your time today. Apologies on the late notice on the Entry eDM details – that was my fault. Please let me know what’s possible for Thurs.

Please can we have the following for McCafe Promo 2021:

-	Entry eDM
o	To be set up as a journey to deploy each day throughout the promo to customers that have bought a qualifying coffee purchase the day prior
o	To deploy each day at 12.30pm after transaction data has run
o	eDM to run from 11 Feb – 24 March (day after campaign start until the day after campaign ends to ensure we capture everybody that makes a eligible transaction over the promo period)
o	Please include Marketing Opt in and MCV Contactable flags – we only want to deploy to customers that are both Marketing opt in and MCV Contactable as this will be a marketing email
o	Is there a possibility to have a data point that tells us how many times someone made an eligible transaction in that day? Upon further discussion, it’d be great to have a variable in the data that says ‘You have received <X> entries into the draw’. Rach is just checking with Tim if each eligible transaction in 1 day counts as an entry. Will confirm but let us know if possible to include


-	Winners eDM
o	To start send from 15th March
o	Use same process as last year where Cap add winners to a DE 
o	This year we are only sending an eDM (no push). We do not need to worry about opt-ins as this will be a service message

Please have a look through and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,

We have been advised by TMS that the 2021 iWIN hourly gameplay reports will no longer have eCP ID,  in its  place will be Hashed DCS ID.  Raymond has already provided preliminary confirmation that SFMC does not store Hashed DCS ID.  

There will be some work that is needed for SFMC to be able to use Hashed DCS ID  to match iWIN gameplay report data for the Monopoly promotion (e.g. push notification, CRM, etc.)

Further investigation will need to take place in order to determine what is the full scope of this change and whether the requirement goes beyond just iWIN gameplay report.

Open Question:  Will it also impact other use cases such as?
•	GMA (SFMC SDK) – push, in app
•	GMA (Blue DOT SDK) – geo 
•	DMP – feeds to/from DMP

Have a think about what would be required to support the storage and use of Hashed DCS ID in SFMC.    

@Ravi,  Please add to the trello board and lets discuss in our WIP.

1.	GMA Customers who have made a transaction at the Parramatta stores in the past month: 4,379
2.	GMA McCafe Customers who have made a transaction at the Parramatta stores in the past month:
-	Could you let us know what the definition for a McCafe Customer is? i.e. Customer who made a coffee purchase?

----

Hi Raymond, 

Yes, McCafe customer = customer who has made a coffee purchase in the past two months 

Looking at that audience volume I think we will need to open this GMA out to a two month window 

Thanks,

Hey Daniel,

 

Thanks for confirming.

 

Looping in Cap & Salesforce for support on this.

 

@Ravikumar – Would you mind confirming which Data Extension is currently being pulled into Redshift for this project?

 

The goal is to send this data to the DMP as well, meaning it’ll need to be formatted accordingly (similar to the User Attributes Pipeline).

 

The options I see currently are:

-          Duplicate the existing DE in the required format and either send this from SFMC to the DMP directly using GoAnywhere.

-          Duplicate the existing DE in the required format, send it along with the original to Redshift, then send the formatted version to the DMP via GoAnywhere.

-          Apply the formatting in Redshift then pass over the DMP.

 

The first option would require the most work from Cap, whereas the third requires more work from CBI. That’s without taking into consideration potential blockers/issues.

 

Daniel/Ravi – What’s your preference based on the above? Do you foresee any issues with any of the methods proposed?

 

Fran – Would you mind sending over some documentation and samples of how the formatting should look for Daniel?

 

Thanks,

Thu 10/09/2020 2:57 PM
Hi Mark and Ravi,

 

As discussed, we need to add an exclusion to the McCafe onboarding eDM so that anyone receiving either Activate or Momentum Monopoly comms are excluded from receiving the McCafe Onboarding eDM.

 

The hierarchy for comms are:

1.       Monopoly eDMs

2.       McCafe Onboarding eDM

3.       BAU Weekly Newsletter eDM

 

This is to avoid customers being sent multiple emails. Push should remain the same.

 

This will be the case over the weeks that Momentum/Activate are running.

 

Please can you update the automation and let me know when it’s done?

 

Let me know if anything is unclear.

I’ve copied in Cap, TMS, Akcelo, OMD, Digitas and Annalect so that we’re all across this.

 

As you would have all heard, we are still moving forward with the release of Chests to all customer in the app. The mass chest open is designed to be a shot in the arm for customers who may churn from the 5th week. We will keep them playing and winning!

 

The overview of the approach is below:

 

Launch

24th Sept or 25th Sept (pending approval)

Action

All customers are given a Chest to open in their Monopoly app.

Rules

All customer with the Monopoly App will receive a Chest, the Chest is live to be redeemed once from 24th / 25th  to the end of the campaign

Media support

We will be supporting this via our sponsorships for 1 to 3 days via the likes of radio.

Initial implications

There are a couple of implications for agencies:

We must be aware of any potential load on the app.
For the week of launch (w/c 21st September) Chests should not be rewarded by the propensity model (unless directed otherwise by @Shimmen Madeleine)
In CRM we have option to communicate this opening to our customers too (@Cali Taylor)
Assuming not all customers open their chest in the first week of it landing in the app, there will be additional chest open flags in the data set (@Parag Gandhi)
 

In terms of next steps:

OMD to confirm the official live day (either 24th or 25th September)
TMS to raise any concerns
Annalect to factor in the data release into the propensity model
 

Please reply back with any questions at all.",5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80a703

459,5f3b1bb22a76d911ec356d12,Monopoly Game play reminder Push,"Effort estimate: 3 days

During the Monopoly campaign 'Game Play Reminder' mobile push messages will be sent out to customers to encourage them to continue to play Monopoly.

There will be 5 'Game Play Reminder' push messages:
1. Chest Open Trigger (You're 1 ticket away from opening the Chest)
2. Unredeemed Chance Code (You have an unredeemed Chance Code)
3. Unredeemed Prize (You have an unredeemed Prize)
4. Unredeemed Chest Open (You have an unredeemed Chest Open)
5. Play Reminder (You haven't played in a while)

There are a number of rules which govern how these push messages can be recieved:

**Rule 1**
Customer can't receive more than 1 out of the 5 Push Notifications per day.

**Rule 2**
Customer can receive 1 of the 5 Push Notifications, if qualified, in the following hierarchy:
1) Chest Open Trigger
2) Unredeemed Chance
3) Unredeemed Prize
4) Unredeemed Chest
5) Play Reminder

**Rule 3**
Customer can't receive the same Push Notification within a 7 day window.

**Rule 4**
If the customer has received a Propensity Monopoly model reward push then don't send one of the above Push Notifications.
___________________________________________________________________________________

The mobile messages will be sent out from a Journey to allow for dynamic content in the messages.

This card details the requirements for the new 'Monopoly App Push - Game Play Reminder' automation that completes the required pre-steps prior to kicking off the Journey.

Thanks for taking me through the propensity data onboarding process on Monday.

As discussed, if you could please setup a new Data Extension using:

-	The file you receive back from OCE (_Inbound > External Segmentation > OAS > OAS Full Segments).
o	Not the raw file you receive from Annalect (_Inbound > SAS > GMA Offers > GMA Offers)

I’ll be able to create segments in Advertising Studio for activation across Facebook to mirror CRM comms.

-	As for the format of this DE, could we please mirror the setup of the DE: _Inbound > SAS > GMA Offers > GMA Offers.
o	Adding in EMAIL as a column.
-	Can we please save this in a new location here: Data Extensions>Audiences>Activation Audiences>2020>Propensity Model
o	Call the DE: Propensity Model

In terms of refresh frequency, having this trigger after you receive the latest data back from OCE makes the most sense, so twice per week. If that’s more complicated than it sound, just setup a daily refresh.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

At the end of each day the Zone DB will provide a list of salted codes that were not used and can be reclaimed by Salesforce. The Zone DB will drop these into an FTP location and this should then trigger a journey to reverse the allocated process and make these codes available for use once more.

 

Note: Please provide the FTP details for the location where this file will need to be stored, and any specific format requirements.

Please confirm if there is a specific IP Range Salesforce uses so we can restrict the Zone DB endpoints to only allow traffic from the Salesforce IP Addresses.

Hi Henry,

Hope you had a good weekend.

Was wondering when will you guys know the final confirmed list of winners for this draw? We would need a final consolidated list from you so that we can use that list to assign the winners the offer in the GMA app. Please let us know.

Also, just FYI, my last day with Capgemini is 19th August 2020, please kindly CC Ravi (ravikumar.kadri@capgemini.com) in all emails moving forward.

Thanks,

There will be three sets of codes that users can be allocated:

 

Codes that provide the user with a chance card
Codes that provide the user with a 1 currency token
Codes that provide the user with a 5 currency token
 

Initially there should be a random split between allocation of chance card codes and 1 currency token codes (split % to be confirmed). At a later time we may need to change the journey to give out 5 currency tokens instead.

 

Note that users can only trigger a zone once a day. The first time a user triggers a zone entry event they should be allocated a code and this should be sent through to the Zone DB. Subsequent entry events for the same user and zone on the same calendar date (AEST) just resend the code that was initially allocated.",5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80a703

ZoneType - Salesforce should filter events based on the ZoneType. Any “Outer” zone events should trigger a Journey to allocate a code to the user. “Inner” zone events can be ignored as they will be handled in the app.

I had a catch up this morning with Chris from our global analytics team, and looks like there is some ongoing registration data issues somewhere in the CDP.

Also given our unique position of having run CRM for longer than other markets & running Monopoly, the registrations don’t map consistently to GMA registrations so he is also keen to see where we might get to around a GMA definition to split out monopoly & GMA users.

 

In regards to next steps:

Chris has asked if we can share what we are seeing ongoing so that he is able to compare to his end/ include our numbers in the global report.

 

@Mark, would you please be able to run the July number add to the below  today so that they can update for the July report they are looking to circulate end of this week?

Also so that the guys have a check in place on going, would you be able to setup an automation file that drops a file with monthly registration numbers into the SFTP so that Chris can then pick up directly each month?

Would be ideal if we can get this setup for August?

Thanks for sending that across.

Looping in @Gaurav/@Ravikumar from Capgem and @Cali/@Simon from Digitas for visibility.

Next Steps:

Marketing Cloud
1.	Khalid to upload the UCG file to the Marketing Cloud FTP.
2.	Capgem to pick up this file (Khalid to provide location), create a Data Extension and append EMAIL to this as well.
a.	Please create a new folder located and named: Data Extensions>_Inbound>Universal Control Group
b.	Call the DE: UCG
3.	Jefri to build out segments in Ad Studio once DE has been created for generic-only targeting across Social.
4.	Digitas to feed this into future emails/push to receive generic-only messaging as well.

Audience Studio
1.	Khalid to format the UCG file to DMP requirements and upload as platform segments.
2.	Jefri to build out standard segments using this data and push to DSPs.

OMD
1.	Tom/Jefri to update Planning & mAccuen teams on how to utilise these UCGs.

Monthly New User (UCG 3) Data Append 
1.	Michael/Parag to send through an updated UCG file each month (Michael, when can we expect this?) with 5k new users appended each month.
a.	For example, this month’s file will be 65k, September will be 70k, October will be 75k and so forth.
2.	When this occurs, we’ll repeat the above steps.
a.	Cap, if possible, can you automate the DE to refresh when Khalid overwrites the file in the MC FTP each month? That will reduce workload on your front.

In terms of timings, we are aiming to have this UCG applied across all direct, social and programmatic channels by Tuesday 18th August.

-	Khalid is the first cab off the ranks and will get this to MC and the DMP by COB today. 
-	Cap, if you could prioritise this for tomorrow, that would be great and I’ll pick it up from there, along with Digitas.
-	Tom, could you please work with Gill and work out how we educate the OMD team on this UCG?

Any questions, please shout team.

Thanks,

ii) Run the queries for all groupids and capture it into a new DE.
iii) As queries as run for each groupid, it needs to be appended to the same new DE.

Subject: Late settlement ApplePay Offer

Hey Airi,
 
Just one to get you up to speed on.
 
We have been able to settle about 30k transactions with apple pay.
We are looking to send a ‘thank you offer’ to try and avoid backlash from customers without also drawing attention to the fact that we processed these payments.
Looking to deploy an Apple pay only offer for a $1 cheeseburger in line with propensity on Friday.
Rainer is working on some copy for the offer description to allude to their apple pay purchase.
 
Will need to look at getting Cap to use the attached list of eCP IDs to as the audience for the offer.
 
Cheers,
Tobi

Hi Laura,
 
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.
 
Unfortunately we may not be able to provide separate rows for multiple entries as there is no easy way in Salesforce that allows us to do this. Is this something that can be done at your end?
 
Also with the microsite entries, are you guys capturing the customer id for each coupon code redeemed? If not, is it something that you guys require us to provide for each matching coupon code? Please advise.

Attached is the 2020 schema for the iWIN hourly files to Salesforce along with sample files for each report.

 

As mentioned previously, we are proposing to add an additional report this year called Burn Report for closed-loop food prizes. This report would confirm the redemption of a food prize through the closed-loop process once iWIN receives this burn information. The other files are unchanged from 2019.

 

I have made some notes in the attached schema (e.g. there will be no “channel” “web” this year due to no microsite) so please let me know if you have any questions.

 

I’ve added Mark and Raymond from CapGem here also, @Lusica Renato can you please add the relevant people from Altis and Annalect so they also have the latest schema?

 

@Shimmen Madeleine for your questions about the data, I will get back to you later today with responses.

Attached are two txt files with the requests necessary to use the ExternalPrizeAward endpoints this year, as well as the response. The requests should be the same as last year’s Monopoly but the response has been updated to support the Real World Monopoly this year.

 

Steps to use these endpoints:

 

First the client must retrieve a Bearer token from Okta
Request format is documented in okta-auth.txt.  The URL and credentials in this file are valid for the staging environment.
Retrieve the userId hash that is returned in the login/handBack response to the app
Select an encrypted code, we will share encrypted codes with you for testing
Provide the AwardType, please use “Salesforce” this year
Submit the request to the external prize award endpoint (examples in ext-prize-award.txt and in the openapi-ext.yaml openapi document)
 

Please let us know if you have any questions on the above.

 

For the award types through the real-time API this year, can you please let us know the use cases for 2020? We are currently only aware of the MOAP award so please let us know if there are more.

 

Thanks,

Kenneth

I’ve also stuck to functionality available in the SSJS SDK (specifically MD5 and Base64) – though you may need to adjust the respective calls to those to match the SDK.

 

From your side, you should only need the salt and checksum functions:

 

function salt(src, ids) {
    var salt = md5(ids.join());
    var bytes = [];
    var srcWithSum = src + '\n' + checksum(src);
    for (i = 0; i < srcWithSum.length; i++) {
        bytes.push(srcWithSum.charCodeAt(i) ^ salt.charCodeAt(i % salt.length))
    }
    return base64Encode(bytes);
}

 

function checksum(src) {
    var checksum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < src.length; i++) {
        checksum += src.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return checksum;
}
 

…but I’ve provided the desalting and some example code and data in the attachment for verification purposes, which should run fine under NodeJS.

 

Note that “ids” is an array of strings in a specific order: the iWin ID, the BlueDot InstallRef, the BlueDot Zone ID, and the app’s unique device identifier

 

The basic approach when salting is:

 

Generate the salt by taking an MD5 of all the input strings concatenated
Calculate a checksum of the ascii chars of the card code
Add the checksum number as a string to the end of the card code (newline separated)
XOR each character of the card-code-and-checksum with the corresponding character of the salt (wrapping around if necessary)
Base64 encode the result
 

And roughly the inverse for de-salting:

 

Generate the salt by taking an MD5 of all the input strings concatenated
Base64 decode the input
XOR each character of the decoded input with the corresponding character of the salt (wrapping around if necessary)
Calculate the checksum of the first line of the result, and ensure it matches the value on the second line
 

Please take a look and let me know if it all seems sensible and achievable… or if you have any other feedback/thoughts/suggestions/concerns.

 

Thanks!

573,5f03ca0659f25d7097ab331f,Marketing Cloud Functionality Doc,"Hi Mark,

 

As discussed last week,  activities relating to the potential transition to ACS are progressing with a kick off meeting happening soon (likely WC 20th July). 

 

Ahead of that kick off, it would be ideal for the attached deck (McDonalds AU Marketing Cloud Functionality v0.1.pptx) prepared by Katie June 2019 to be updated to reflect current state of SFMC.  There have been significant changes and enhancements that need to be added or updated so as to ensure that the document is a complete reflection of everything we leverage in SFMC.

 

Can you work towards proving an updated SFMC Functionality deck by Tuesday 21st July,   this a date two weeks from today?

 

Also attached is a deck (Segmented Offers Overview_AU June 2020.pptx) shared by global that walks through the features and capabilities of ACS.   It would be ideal to familiarise yourself with ACS features and prepare and take note of any questions you’d want answered in future meetings.   I’ve already provided early feedback that a detailed demo session walking through each feature and capability in ACS would be essential to ensure that there is no misunderstanding in the interpretation of each of the points.

 

We can discuss further during our weekly Salesforce WIP,  probably best to add on Trello as a reminder for WIP.  We can also have a separate catch-up to discuss the ask if required.

 

Thanks

577,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80aaad,R6 CCP for AU - Provide Salesforce Unsubscribes & Resubscribes batch file for certain e-mail addresses,"This request to the Salesforce team is to address an issue in CCP where, for a number of cases, a 'CCP profile ID' or 'Recipient ID' is associated with 2 active e-mail addresses. This issue is not on account of Salesforce or DCS 1.0 events but due to a defect in CCP. The CCP team will also be requesting DCS to run 'Autoheal' process to submit / resubmit events for affected DCS IDs or e-mail addresses to resolve this issue after which CCP plans to updates its Opt status from the 2 Salesforce batch files (Unsubscribes & Resubscribes).
Post AU R6 release to Production we would like to run a process in CCP to resolve this issue so that each e-mail address is associated to one and only one CCP Profile ID.
To do that we will need the following from Salesforce.
(1)  CCP will provide a list of e-mail addresses for which we will want Salesforce to send us the Opt status in the Unsubscribes or Resubscribes file. if email address has Unsubscribes Opt status then its records will be in the Unsubscribes file but if that e-mail address has Resubscribe opt status then its records will be in the Resubscribes file. 
There is no change to the file layout / structure or how the files are delivered to CCP through Partner Gateway.
(2)  We should test this in non-Prod or UAT environment of CCP. Post UAT approval we will plan its implementation in Prod.
(3)  Please provide work effort & cost estimate (for UAT testing & Production deployment etc.) for Salesforce work effort?
(4) Will be great if we can complete the non-prod testing by 6-Mar-2020?
Consider this as a one time requirement so preferable for Salesforce to consider the simplest solution to read a text file that has a list of e-mail addresses and on that basis to produce the Unsubscribes & Resubscribes file and send to CCP through existing Partner Gateway.

588,5efe7430248ec482585f7185,JIRA PROD (CCPM-1189) AU - Multiple active e-mail addresses for the same DCS ID,"Hi Gaurav, Piyush,

This is coming out of my conversation with Renato last night US time (01-Jun-2020).
I had informed him that CCP Production has around 145 unique e-mail addresses which, in pairs, are associated to the same DCS ID / CCP Profile ID. In other words, we have these few cases (out of 10+ million active AU customers) showing 2 unique e-mail addresses (and sometimes more) for the same DCS ID. Based on reading of such e-mail addresses it belongs to the same customer. My understanding is that the AU Payloads from DCS should have only 1 e-mail address per customers. AU GMA / MMC does not allow customers to specify secondary e-mails at registration or later & so the payload if having more than 1 e-mail address is perhaps a bug in the process prior to CCP.

Example, DCS_ID: 123456789012  is associated with piyush@gmail.com as well as piyush@yahoo.com within the same payload from DCS where the piyush@gmail.com has primary indicator value of “Y” and the other has an “N”.
1.	
Perhaps there is no “serious” business impact but would like to check with you whether for such cases will Salesforce send marketing / push etc. notifications to both piyush@gmail.com as well as to piyush@yahoo.com OR just to piyush@gmail.com?         Could you please let us know in relation to the actual DCS IDs in JIRA CCPM-1189? Does SLSF have 2 active e-mail addresses associated with each of those DCS IDs?

Thank you,
Unni

Hello Arvind Sudarsanam / TEK LAMA

We observed the following issues in the most recent file sent by C360 ""MCD_C360_AUDIT_ACTVGRP_AU_PRD_20200518070656.psv"" on 18/05

a. The file contained multiple duplicate records for the same DCS ID/Group ID combination as can be seen in the examples below.

62036000000002045|2045|912|$3 Big Mac|2020/04/01 07:00:14

The expectation is to receive only the latest and greatest record for each unique DCS Id/Group Id assignment.
Is C360 sending only Action 1 (additions) records or does the file include Action 2 (removals) also ?

b. Junk value found in the data as can be seen in the example below:

DatatypemistmatchInv|1948|400|MUAT $3 McChicken - 402|2020/03/24 06:26:32
DatatypemistmatchInv|1948|400|MUAT $3 McChicken - 402|2020/03/24 06:26:32

Expectation is to receive only valid DCS Ids as a number. But text values were observed in the data.

Kindly correct these issues and resend the file so that we can test it and confirm its meeting the requirements.

Thank you.

Kedhaar

Thanks for your e-mail.     As you may know, Piyush & Gaurav Shrestha works in Australia AEST hours (normally its like between 6 PM and 2 AM CST / Chicago time) & are part of the Salesforce team in AU.

I did not understand the purpose of the following 2 statements to the Salesforce team from your e-mail below since it does not sound True as to how it is currently done. You said …
(a1) Currently we are picking production files from S3 bucket “us-east-1-cprod-us-cds-globaloutbound/Epsilon/AU” ad will continue to do the same. 
(a2) Please provide us the DEV bucket details where we need to connect to conduct these tests. 

Salesforce “pushes” or “sends” the files to PG (Partner Gateway) today. Salesforce does not have non-prod environments like DEV / QA / UAT etc. They only have a Production environment. When we request Salesforce to send test files to CCP in non-prod (which CCP calls the UAT environment) we simply request they send the 2 types of test files ( with filename pattern noted in (f1) & (f2) below ) by first encrypting it with the PGP public key that DMaaS provides.

The instructions that Jesse provided the Salesforce team (but at that time it was to a different Salesforce person) in Sep-2018 was as follows.
(b1)   sftp 3PtoE-AU-Salesforce@partnergateway_dev.mcd.com                 (for non-prod or UAT)
(b2)   sftp 3PtoE-AU-Salesforce@partnergateway_eu.mcd.com                   (for Prod)

For testing purposes Salesforce team would send the following 2 types of files to non-prod and/or prod which files only will have header row in it & no data rows.
(f1) MCD_eCPCustBatch_AU_PRD_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss_SLSF.dat.pgp     (UAT file should have UAT instead of PRD in the filename)
(f2) MCD_SLSF_OPT_AU_PRD_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.dat.pgp                         (UAT file should have UAT instead of PRD in the filename)

Are you asking Salesforce team to do the following?
(c1) PGP encrypt the files using the attached keys (use respective keys for non-prod & prod testing)
(c2) Then use the exact commands in (b1) & (b2) to send the 2 files 
(c3) and tell us the 2 non-prod & 2 prod “test” files they sent

If I am wrong with any of the steps (c1) to (c3) then please provide the exact steps they need to do for the testing?

Thank you,

Currently we are picking production files from S3 bucket “us-east-1-cprod-us-cds-globaloutbound/Epsilon/AU” ad will continue to do the same. The only thing that will change from your end is, you will have to use our new PGP keys to encrypt the files.

We would like to conduct a quick test or rather a UAT in our stage environment to make sure the flow is working as designed, could you please help us conduct these tests??
Please provide us the DEV bucket details where we need to connect to conduct these tests. Also I have attached our PGP STAGE and PROD public keys that you will need to use to encrypt the files.

Please advise.

Regarding the “Email Health Report Data Assistance_YYYYMMDD.csv” file. Would it be feasible to have this as a running week or fortnight long record, rather than a single day? I’m thinking about it from a reporting perspective, and it is a lot less risky to from our point of view.

Also how is the conversation about the push data going?

Best,
Jack

Re: R6 for AU - Full set of Unsubscribes & Resubscribes batch files after IR047 implementation 


Hi Gaurav Shrestha,
CCP team is planning to execute ( this ticket associated to what CCP team calls ""IR047"" ) on Tuesday 23-Jun-2020.
At that time I will update this ticket to request you & Piyush to provide the ""FULL"" load of ""Unsubscribes"" (through files having filename pattern ""MCD_eCPCustBatch_AU_PRD_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss_SLSF.dat"") & ""Resubscribes"" (through files having filename pattern ""MCD_SLSF_OPT_AU_PRD_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.dat"") data from AU Salesforce to CCP Production. These files will therefore have ALL active non-deleted AU customers in them for the unsubscribes (opted out customers) & those customers who have resubscribed (or opted back in).
These FULL load files are to be delivered using the same method (i.e. through Partner Gateway) that Salesforce has been sending CCP since Feb-2019. We had done this FULL load process at least twice in the past but it was with a different Salesforce member who had done that (and I am note recollecting whether Piyush was part of 1 of those FULL loads to CCP process). 
At this time I just need your confirmation that you have understood my request & will be able to send the FULL load of Unsubscribes & Resubscribes data to CCP Production when requested to do so on 23-Jun-2020. Please confirm that you have understood this request? Let me know if you have any questions? There will be multiple Unsubscribes files since there will be millions of such customer profiles & I think (though I am not 100% sure) that Resubscribes records will just be in 1 file to CCP.
Let me know if you have any questions. Piyush had worked with me for CCP since a weeks before Katie Dale left the project / account.
Thank you,
Unni

I had a catch-up with Chris earlier today and have the following updates:

 

Find attached updated sample data with updated date/time format.   The attached leverages same data as before,  not a full re-export as this would take a bit of time. 

 

Chris is aiming to complete the full solution by COB Friday 12th June.

 

In order for him to complete his work he will need the following:

·         Confirmation that file per attached format sample is OK

·         Salesforce SFTP details that he can send files to:  SFTP server details,  credentials and path

Hi Michael,

Our app dev team was able to resolve the issue of in-app message auto dismiss in the iOS version but the issue with Android version still persists.
After some investigation and hit & trials, our app dev team has posted the following questions.
Could you please review and provide some answers ?

To resolve this auto dismiss issue we capture the message data and show that message by using below method which is describe in this doc : https://salesforce-marketingcloud.github.io/MarketingCloudSDK-Android/in-app-message/in-app-messaging.html\

MarketingCloudSdk.requestSdk(new MarketingCloudSdk.WhenReadyListener() {
@Override
public void ready(@NonNull MarketingCloudSdk marketingCloudSdk) {
String inAppMessage = LocalDataManager.getSharedInstance(). getString(AppCoreConstants.SALESFORCE_CLOUD_INAPP_MESSAGE_ID,AppCoreConstants.EMPTY_STRING);
_if(!AppCoreUtils._isEmpty(inAppMessage))
{ __ marketingCloudSdk.getInAppMessageManager().showMessage(inAppMessage); Log._d_(*""SF_INAPP_SHOW""*, *""""*+inAppMessage + *""""*); }
}
});

But when sending the in app from server, app is not showing the msg.
In Android Studio Log, we found that in app msg is get downloaded. I have logged the msg after showMessage() method. I can confirm that log generate the msg.
However it cannot show in app.
I go back to background and come to foreground multiple time . But still do not see the in app pop up although Android log is saying app is showed.

We used Salesforce SDK version 6.3.5
Here is in app msg implementation in McdMarketApplication.java
MarketingCloudSdk.requestSdk(new MarketingCloudSdk.WhenReadyListener() {
@Override public void ready(@NonNull MarketingCloudSdk sdk) {
Log.d(""SDKSTATE"", sdk.getSdkState().toString());
//Generate token here to test the saleforce push notification
_Log._d(""TOKEN"", sdk.getPushMessageManager().getPushToken()+"" "");
sdk.getInAppMessageManager().setInAppMessageListener(
new InAppMessageManager.EventListener() {
@Override
public boolean shouldShowMessage(@NonNull InAppMessage inAppMessage)
{ Log._d_(*""SF_INAPP_RECEIVE""* , *""""*+ inAppMessage + *""""*); LocalDataManager._getSharedInstance_().set (AppCoreConstants.*_SALESFORCE_CLOUD_INAPP_MESSAGE_ID_*, inAppMessage.id()); return false; }
@Override
public void didShowMessage(@NonNull InAppMessage inAppMessage)
{ }
@Override
public void didCloseMessage(@NonNull InAppMessage inAppMessage)
{ Log._d_(*""SF_INAPP_CLOSE""* , *""""*+ inAppMessage + *""""*); }
});
}
});

Please find attached the android studio logs which I captured which included the in app msg logs. (Android_INAPP_MSG_Log.txt)

Thank you.

Subject: McCafe Promotion - Prize Draw Process

Hey Airi,
 
Hope you’re well. Just thought I’d put together a brief email with priority things to be discussed as part of the McCafé consumer promotion. Happy to chat through on Monday. 
 
1. First Prize Draw Timeline
As part of the T&Cs for the McCafé comp, we need to specify dates for when the 1st prize draw will happen. Creata have shared the following timeline with actions for both Tribal and the McD Digi team. Are you able to let me know if there’s likely to be any issues with the below? If the timings are too tight then we can postpone one week. This needs to be confirmed by COB Monday.
 
Mon, 20 Jul	
Tue, 21 Jul	Competition Ends
Wed, 22 Jul	
Thu, 23 Jul	Microsite Entries Close
Fri, 24 Jul	 
Sat, 25 Jul	 
Sun, 26 Jul	 
Mon, 27 Jul	Tribal to share entries from microsite & McD’s Digital to share GMA entries with Creata
Tue, 28 Jul	1st Prize Draw Complete 
Creata shares list of winner ID’s back to McD’s Digital team
Wed, 29 Jul	McD’s digital provide PII data to Creata for winners
Thu, 30 Jul	Creata check winners against HR records
Fri, 31 Jul	Creata to contact winners
Sat, 1 Aug	 
Sun, 2 Aug	 
 
2. Prize Live Dates
In addition to the above, I’ve also started to put together a very rough timeline with proposed live dates for prizes. Are you able to please review and let me know if any issues.
 
3. Winner Comms
During the WIP call on Tuesday, it was mentioned that Creata would be best to send out all comms to winners. However, after viewing their refined estimate, we will likely need to look at an alternative which I would think sits with Digitas. Are you happy for me to go back and discuss them potentially contacting and receiving responses from winners?

Subject: In-App Notification Data from MC to DMP

 

Hey Gaurav,

 

Hope you had a nice weekend.

 

I was chatting to Maddy earlier and she mentioned we’re now sending in-app notifications to customers.

 

She wants to ingest this data into the DMP but I don’t have a great understanding of what exactly this is.

 

Do you have any documentation on what’s available, how it works, what the types of notifications are etc.?

 

Let me know if it’s easier to schedule a call to talk through, I appreciate this is a very broad request.

 

Thanks,

Hey guys,

 

As it is an LBO it shouldn’t be associating to a customer, LBO should be visible to all customers so shouldn’t have anything to do with receiving a push/email or not.

 

However, the only think I can think of is that offer opt in has been corrupted somewhere? Marty are you able to provide the details of your account where you couldn’t see it? @Mark Koh – can you or someone in the team check offer opt in status.

 

Otherwise could there be anything front end that would impact?

Subject: RE: Sat offer missing

 

Hi

 

In my case I received a push notification while my martin.dittmar@au.mcd.com account was signed into the app, yet that account didn’t have the offer.

I checked my 3 other accounts listed and neither had it (assuming all should have it). My local store my phone was set to was Wyong 950093 which has the correct site # in OCE.

Given I received a push notification about the offer the offer should be valid at any restaurant, correct?

 

I also do not receive emails for any offers across these accounts. I’ve mentioned this several times previous.

 

In the customer complaint it does sound the same as me, they received a notification but their offers didn’t have it.

I don’t have any way to know if the offer was assigned to that account successfully, is that something you can do Airi, DJ?

 

* Also, I’m still to reconcile & correct the site numbers in OCE, I’m behind on this. I’m hoping to get to this by EOW.  :s

Few questions for you:
1)	Do you also have daily opt ins for Push? Or would this be new sign ups/downloads?
2)	How do people opt out? Is this system opt outs in their device? Or is there a mechanic within the app too?
3)	Which report can we use to see daily Push sends? (If this is possible…)
4)	Confirmation of current Push notifications deployed & audience sizes (rough):

Message	Audience	Audience Size	Mon	Tue	Wed	Thu	Fri	Sat	Sun

We have an urgent test we would like to conduct to test the relative performance of a few different offers we would like to test from Friday.

 

Looking to do the following:

 

Audience definitition: Annalect (Timing – ASAP - EOP today)

6x test cells: 20,000 users (Created to be representative of total base – ie. should have proportionate mix of different segments)

Each test cell to receive 1 of the following offers:

20% off $10 min spend (To be rerun as control) (Results from last week: $16.80 AC, 64.9% GP 144k redemptions)
20% off $15 min spend (Current reco)
30% off $15 min spend
30% off $20 min spend
40% off $15 min spend
40% off $20 min spend
Use control to be able to extrapolate likely overall result for non media supported performance of all 6 of the above.

So would require Annalect to build 6 test audiences and then would need to be setup as additional offers/segments. Ideally would launch Firday so that we can get a view end of next week about how they perform.

@Annalect, Happy to take your recommendation/feedback on the above.

 

 

Offer setup: Annalect/Capgem

Deployed for Friday launch (1 week availability)
These will be additional offers (ie people in these audiences should still receive their regular offers)
Customer should receive push message for both this offer and the other offer they have
 

Please can you let us know if you think there will be issues in being able to turn this around? For this Friday deployment?

 

Thanks,
Tobi

For Propensity Offers from Thursday last week, there 43,097 records that were present in Annalect's file but did not exist in the MCV because of which the DCS ID couldnt be fetched for these records and hence these records were not included as a part of the c360 outbound. Out of those 43,907 records, 13,436 records seem to be present in service cloud but with the flag Is_Deleted. The remaining 29,661 records seem to be missing from Service Cloud as well.

Subject: Salesforce Data Retention & Backups

Hi G

Following on from the conversation in our meeting I just want to raise the issue regarding the retention time limits that are in place in Salesforce
As we know most of the system tables only contain data for the last 6 months

The current backup DE for opens [Open Data View - Backup] has the latest record date of 2nd February 2020
The earliest date available in the core open DE [_open] is 22nd January 2020
We do risk losing valuable history if the backup table isn’t updated in the next 10 days

In addition to this there are currently no backup DE’s for the other logs i.e. _sent, _bounce, _click, _unsubscribe
This makes it extremely difficult to understand year on year metrics or to produce any trends for more than 6 months

_job has data going back to 2019 but I would be keen to know what the data retention setting is for this DE.

Could we put in place a process which will create ongoing history DE’s for these core data sources without deletion after a set period of time

The same applies for all PUSH data although I do understand that you are creating [DMP MOBILEPUSH DATA HISTORY]. Will this be updated without any deletion after 6 months etc?

Happy to discuss in more detail if required

Many thanks
Simon

Hi Team,


Here are some notes that we can review to expedite conversation.

 

 

OIT – Offers Input Tool

A platform that will allow marketers like Airi to create and schedule Offers campaign ahead of time.  Days, weeks, months ahead of time.

 

 

Salesforce Requirement.  Produce a Segment File

·         Salesforce Segment files from SFTP.

·         Files to include Group ID and Group name

 

 

Filename

OCE_SalesforceSegmentFile_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.CSV

 

File Format

Group_ID, Group_Name

8005,$1 Hash Brown

8015, $2 Cheeseburger

 

Schedule/Frequency

Adhoc – whenever new and/or update

 

Send to

SFTP Server

 

Notes

·         Needs to be sent ahead of campaign being created/published

·         Create a range of GroupID, GroupName for adhoc purpose

 

 

 

The above will unlock the following on OIT

 

·         Check for OCE_SalesforceSegmentFile_*.CSV every hour

·         Process when new OCE_SalesforceSegmentFile_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.CSV is found

 

 

·         On OIT for audience set-up

·         Display list of all Salesforce  Group ID and Group Name

·         Ability to search by Group ID (exact match) or Group Name (partial match)

·         Ability to select a single Salesforce segment",5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80a703

Apologies for not getting this to you sooner.

Regarding the [DMP MOBILEPUSH DATA HISTORY[ DE which you create, I wasn’t aware that this is specifically for Annalect to use.
Ideally what we would like is something identical to this but with TITLE & MESSAGE added in so we know the contents of the Push message.
You also mentioned yesterday that MESSAGEID may be a unique identifier for each Push Message. If this is the case then to get this added would also be very useful

Could you also confirm if InApp messages would also flow through to this DE?

Many thanks

Regarding the reporting piece. The ultimate goal is to be able to identify for each email/push/inApp message that someone receives what was the content that was served to them. As customer move through the process it becomes difficult to work out at a particular point in time what they were eligible for etc

 

Some emails have the ‘if eligible’ modules and Phase 4 – the dynamic hero will be dependent on the customers segment. I need to be able to say for example:

Customer A during Phase 4, they were ‘Regular’ so the Hero Module was ‘X’, they also got modules 1,3 & 5

                But the following week they may have moved to ‘Super’ so the hero module will change and potentially so will the other modules

Ultimately for every email that gets sent to each customer, we need a log of what impression(s) that email contained.

 

This will enable us to understand the impact of different modules

 

Does that make sense? 

 

Happy to jump on a call if it’s easier

Hi Airi, Maddy,

We have updated the code for VISA and it is ready to go live
 
There are 129,000 customers who are eligible for the VISA voucher, who have yet received it
 
•	Previously users were flagged as ineligible if they had made any ePayment. It was set up this way as the VISA payment flag was not available at the time
•	We have changed this so that users are only flagged ineligible if they have made payment with VISA previously
 
Actions:
@Shrestha, Gaurav, @Dornala, Kalpana - We will run a test with you today
 
@Sutherland Airi, @Shimmen Madeleine - How would you prefer to proceed – options below:
•	Option 1: Put the code change live and the 129,000 users will be flagged as eligible for the voucher, and will be sent to CapGemini in addition to any other eligible users making payments this week as part of the standard process
•	Option 2: We can batch the sending vouchers to users, an or provide a customised message outside of the usual process (this allows more control over the release of these vouchers if needed)
 
Cheers

Hi guys,

We also looked into this earlier today and could not recreate the issue. Most probably it is a case of someone trying to unsubscribe from an old email but his/her record no longer existed in Salesforce (could be a deleted account) which might have caused the error message to be displayed.

Emma (cc’d) is working on a fix for Feb Game campaign issue relating to eCPID.   

There is a Global issue in which DCS isn’t giving back the ECPID to MMC for newly registered users.

In order to validate the fix that MMC has put together they need to verify that the ECPID they are getting is correct for that user in PROD.

Emma will reach out requesting for some information.    Along the lines of asking for what Salesforce has on record as an EID for user email addresses.    

Appreciate If you can alert the right member of the team who can perform this test for Emma to progress this support issue.

Thanks

Regards,
Renato

The purpose of this journey is to encourage new customers who have not transacted since receiving their welcome offer to make a purchase. 

Offer (valid for 14 days) 
25% off your order, minimum spend of $15  
Propensity
This journey sits outside of the propensity model as customers are unknown prior to their first transaction 
When
EDM 3 (Activation): 7 days after receiving EDM 2, if the customers has still not made a purchase
EDM 4 (Follow Up): 7 days after receipt of EDM 3, if the customers has still not made a purchase 

NB
For the two journeys above, the offers and segments will need to be created and passed through daily for offer set up until March when the expiry date issue is fixed in CIM – thus it may be worth exploring an automation to facilitate. This needs further discussion with TRACK and CAP, I will arrange a catch up with Mark and Reagon next week to chat through feasibility/approach.

Hope you’re both well.

I saw that we’re receiving a daily file with live offers in the MC FTP here: /Import/Monopoly/TMSHK/OCE

One of the initiatives that Macca’s want to deploy is to excluding messaging users across Facebook who have already redeemed their offer (as this currently doesn’t happen).

I believe that by combining this data set and the TLD, we can identify users on a daily basis who have redeemed their offer and consequently exclude them from messaging, by creating a Data Extension, then pushing this to Advertising Studio -> Facebook as Custom Audiences.

I believe you can match the ecp_campaign_id in the campaign_template2019092340130.csv file against the promotion_bk in the TLD at the user level, to create a segment of redeemers.

Could you please let me know if this is feasible?

777,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80a931,ACTION REQUIRED: All 'Send From' addresses/domains require verification,"What is Address Management/Domain Verification? 

Simply put, Domain Verification is a workflow to verify all sending addresses used by your organization for email sends. From Address Management is a new page in Email Studio Admin. This page is the master record for all the From addresses used in an account. From addresses found in the Email Admin Account Settings, My Users, and Sender Profiles also are added to From Address Management once the verification process has been initiated. Additionally, you are able to search and see the status of all From addresses as well as add a single From address or import a list of From addresses.

To streamline the verification process and avoid sending restrictions, it is possible to verify the sending domain used in the from address (see Verify by domain below). If the domain is verified using Sender Authentication Package (SAP) or Domain Registration for non-authenticated domains, the From addresses using these verified domains can be verified without sending an email to that full address.

The enforcement of this verification will be rolled out according to the schedule below:
 
Enterprise ID	Account Name 	Enforcement Date 
6232116	McDonald's Corporation 	8/14/2019

Hope you are well! As per discussed last week, as part of a ‘best practice’ to reduce cost, increase deliverability and get better metrics I have proposed a new approach for the National Newsletter sends -  This has already been discussed and approved with the team.
 
We will now only send to records who have opened an email within the last 180 days and (when possible) through a journey using EINSTEIN persona split to test how they perform and maybe use this tool for engagement optimisation in the future.

We have important news about an upcoming change to your REST API permissions. As part of our commitment to security, we are changing the way permissions are managed for many Marketing Cloud REST API routes. We recommend Marketing Cloud customers review their user permissions before April 1, 2019, or some users and integrations accessing Marketing Cloud via the API may have restricted permissions, which could affect how integrations continue to function after April 1, 2019. We’ve created a new custom report to help ensure that your users and integrations will have the correct permissions when accessing the Marketing Cloud. 

What actions do I need to take? 
Customers should review the Permission Adjustment report, and ensure permissions are configured properly, well before April 1, 2019. To prepare for the REST API permissions update, please follow the steps below: 
  
1. 	Run the Permission Adjustments Report: Run the report to determine which users and integrations may be impacted by the permissions update. Follow the instructions in the Developer Documentation. 

2. 	Update Permissions for Users and Applications: Update your permissions based on the information reviewed in the report by following the steps outlined in the “Update the REST API User Permissions” article. 
3. 	Confirm Updated Permissions: To confirm, make the same API calls again and then rerun the report. It may take up to 24 hours for details to appear in the report. For more information, follow the instructions in the “Confirm your REST API permissions” article. 
  
If no action is taken, some users and integrations may have restricted permissions within Marketing Cloud after the change occurs on April 1, 2019. This could result in API calls failing for integrations. 

How can I get more information? 
To learn more about REST API permissions, check out the Documentation page. 

For additional questions, please open a case with Support via Salesforce Help.

Overview:
The AU market delayed upgrade until 2018. The ODS team loaded historical data (customer data only) from ECP. The purpose of this ticket is for Salesforce to provide customer data counts by create date so ODS team can validate its data.
Below are a few of the items sent via email to move this ticket forward:
General information for Query: for each day (Create Date) provide the number of customers/accounts created (count) with a valid account (valid ECP ID). (each ECP ID is not yet required, only the count per day)
Query Used by ODS:
This is a general query we have used against the ODS database to look at counts by date. It may need to be modified based on your table names, but it does include the ‘crte_acct_utc_ts’ value that we discussed on the call.
Select SUBSTRING(CAST(crte_acct_utc_ts AS NVARCHAR(11)), 1, 10) as Acctcrte , count as Countofrowsprocessed

839,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80a846,P1 - Questions re MCV daily snapshot - Maccas CRM Dashboard,"Hi Piyush,

Can you please look into this one?

Shanglin has some questions on the data we are providing in the Annalect export files:

1.	240778,  2330434, 2407785,  2562738: not present in the latest MCV_daily_snapshot file but got sent emails;
2.	100451690, 100579903, 6359800, 100535394, 100398977: got sent emails before they were added to the database (email sent date < mcv optin date)

The MCV Daily snapshot is just that - a snapshot of MCV (taken at 7:30pm) that is dropped into the Export/Annalact/MCV Daily Snapshot folder.
The sent dates are being determined from the Email Health report data.

I have already checked and confirmed that for 1. the ECP_Ids are not in the ‘MCV Deleted Customers - Pre DCS’ data extension (which contains the ECP_Ids deleted from MCV that had IS_DELETED = 1) so I am not sure how these ECP Ids got into the Email Health report extracts though it is possible they were deleted from MCV prior to the ‘MCV Deleted Customers’ process being initiated. Could you please find out what was the last date these ECP Ids were sent emails?

For 2. the ‘mcv optin date’ is the MCV ‘UTC_DATE_ADDED’ field.

As part of Monopoly we are opting all customers who log into Monopoly into offers automatically. This means that we no longer have an accurate measure of how many registered customers have GMA and it impacts our ability to deliver welcome offers (on hold until Dec). 
 
Post Monopoly the ideal scenario is that we revert the offer opt in status of all customers who logged in via Monopoly but have not accessed GMA. To do this we would need to deliver the below -
 
•	a view of all customers opted into offers prior to Monopoly (as of the 4th Sept EOP)
•	a view of all customers opted into offers via Monopoly (DDB to share post campaign)
•	a view of all customers who have logged into GMA since 5th Sept 
 
Can you confirm if we can source the first point from SF? I'm hoping we can use the OCE offer segment 'all customers' for this. 
 
Can you also confirm if you'll be able to do the analysis required to identify users we should be opting back out? The DCS team will be responsible for making the changes however will need us to provide the data to them in order to make the changes. At the moment we've schedule this in for the 3rd Dec so would need to carry out the analysis on that date (to ensure the data is up to date) and provide to them on the same day. 
 
Thanks

872,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80a7eb,November Calendar - Audience Builder Offer Attribute,"Bringing this conversation back up in your radar. I’ve reached out to James regarding the promo IDs and he’s gotten back to me saying that they are only able to generate the promo id on the day of the offer release. 

Just to give you an understanding of what we’re trying to do for the November campaign, we’d like to retarget any user who has redeemed an offer from the campaign. Additionally, we’d like to segment them according to the number of offers they’ve redeemed. Some things that are blocking us in terms of automating this would be:
1.	We can only get the promo ID for the campaign-relevant promos on the day of (see attached email thread on this conversation).
2.	We do not have this set up on audience builder. 

To address these, I’m wondering if you could potentially come up with the distinct list of promo IDs from the TLD data as a DE and when they were added into the list? Something like below (dummy data):

Promotion_bk	SFMC Date Added
30762	20/10/2018
31566	21/10/2018
…	…
12345	01/11/2018

Then, from this list, we are able to see all the new promotion_bk IDs that have been added for the duration of the campaign, November 1 to 30. Using this list, you can then create a query which captures users who transacted with a promotion_bk ID that fell in that sub list (distinct promotion_bk where date added is from November 1 to 30). While this may not be 100% accurate, we could be fairly confident that these promotion_bk IDs are the ones related to the campaign.

From there, could we then add this in as an attribute in the audience builder where I can go in and edit the number of times a user redeemed a campaign-related offer?

I would need the number of offers (from the list we’ve filtered) a customer has redeemed to be able to create segments of users depending on how many they’ve redeemed.

1. Please can you remove all customers included in the D1 Unclaimed tab attached from the existing McCafe Competition Winners segment

Please ignore the D1 claimed tab.

This DE is built from a query which overwrite the DE with new records to be entered into the journey. However for the update contact activity to work, the contact has to exist in that target DE which it does not currently because the DE is being overwritten by the query. When the activity tries to update the contact it does not find the contact in that DE and fails. 

The update contact activity in the journey is supposed to update a flag in the DE to indicate that contact has completed the journey. This flag is then used to build the MONOPOLY_NEWSLETTER DE in its segmentation criteria. But since the flag is not being populated correctly the newsletter audience is not being built correctly.

Q: Do you know if the 'update contact activity' only does an update to a DE, or can it also insert if the contact record does not already existing in the DE?
Ans: Update contact activity will only update those matching records in target DE it will not insert any new records in the data extension.

We’re looking into getting dynamic push notifications live from next week onwards.
At the moment we’re using the same push copy for every offer segment, from next we should use dynamic copy based on offer segments.

It might be a little too optimistic to be able to implement for Tuesday’s Push but can we aim for Thursday?

What we will do is basically take Annalects output file and include one column to showcase the Push Notification copy that should go to each segment. Please see dummy file attached.

What are your timings on this and when do you need the final copy by the latest?

Please note that I will on leave from Monday on but Angie (cc) will cover for me.

Let me know if you have any questions.

As a user in the Marketing Cloud with access to the MobilePush application, we want to notify you that your Marketing Cloud MobilePush application 'GMA Staging' with App ID '1e3d2780-2fe5-4994-9b2e-7031a4dd2d24' has an APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) certificate that will expire on Monday, 24 June 2019.

An active APNS certificate is required by Apple for third party applications to send messages. Once it expires, your org will not be able to send push notifications through the Marketing Cloud to Apple devices until the certificate is updated.

What action do I need to take?
Provisioning information must be added to your Apple AppCenter. The AppCenter is where MobilePush stores APNS certificates. For more information on the steps your org will need to take to initiate the certificate update, click here. 

If your org does not have access to the email address used for the AppCenter account, please submit a support case including the application???s ApplicationID and the new email address that you would like to use. Moving forward, your org should use an email alias (if available) to avoid further issues.

What does this change mean for my org?
If your org would like to continue using the MobilePush application, a new certificate from Apple must be generated for the application and uploaded into your AppCenter account. If your org would no longer like to continue using it, please remove the application from the AppCenter account.

How can I get more information?
To connect with the broader Salesforce community and experts on APNS certificates, visit: success.salesforce.com/answers

The survey will target 14 - 24 year olds (Anna & Alicia, please confirm) and we would want to build the segment to target only those users who are opted into offers & are accepted by CIM, to ensure they can receive offers. @Katie Dale & @Eswaran, Kedhaar could you help build the audience for this?

1001,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80aa1b,Newcastle - MyMaccas Targeting,"Hi Jefri & Mark,

I’d like some help please with an audience selection / sizing for some upcoming campaign work. 

The campaign is for the launch of “smarter” drive thru experiences which use license plate recognition to remember customers and personalise the menu boards according to previous orders. This is a trial which is running in just the Newcastle area, ahead of rollout later in 2020.

I’m hoping to identify an audience of MyMacca’s customers in the broader Newcastle area. 

Conceptually, I’d like to identify customers whose primary McDonald’s purchases are in this region (see identified restaurants below). That is, we need to identify infrequent or visiting customers and ensure they are not counted in an audience.

 
Suggest we identify:
1.	All customers who have purchased from the combined set of stores identified (in the past 6-months); and
2.	Remove those who have more frequent purchases from Macca’s stores outside of the identified region
a.	Suggest this is based upon number of days where a purchase is made. i.e. if a customer has made 10 purchases on discrete days in Newcastle but has 14 purchases in 6 day period outside of the area, they would still be included (rule 10>6)

Can you please let me know who is best equipped to build this audience? Any ideas on how we best “ring fence” this audience would be appreciated.  

Ideally we’d get counts now and then refresh the audience selection once the campaign launches in February.

Our aim is to integrate store visitation data from Wi-Fi logins into both DMP and MC platforms in order to target and tailor comms based on this. Value and use cases include:
•	Match user to CRM to build known consumer 360
•	Push GA userID to SF DMP to build insights into Wi-Fi consumers broader behaviours
•	Understand behaviours. Loyalists vs infrequents
•	Map Wi-Fi high connection times and days overlaid with transactional data to understand incremental benefits of Wi-Fi and dwell times
•	Consumer store preference – 1 to many stores
•	Consumer behaviours by store. Do certain stores deliver superior dwell time – Investigate why

Salesforce DMP: We had DMP Wi-Fi tracking in place for all non-Telstra stores and would like to replicate the same setup for all stores with Telstra Wi-Fi now. Jefri, Tom and Adam from OMD lead our DMP implementation and strategy and will be the key contacts for this. 
Salesforce Marketing Cloud: There is no existing integration of Wi-Fi data into Marketing Cloud. We'd be looking to see if you are able to surface the data we require into Marketing Cloud via an API integration
 
The data we would be looking to track would include the below:
 eCP ID of users who are using Wi-Fi
hashed eMail address 
store
time of day 
day of week 

Tags:
•	See attached

Data Collected:
•	GA User ID (Google Advertising ID)
•	Krux User ID (Salesforce DMP ID)
•	CRM User ID (eCP ID – Salesforce Marketing Cloud)
•	Hashed email address
•	Store Name

Thanks,

Maddy 


What’s Maccas Free Wi-Fry®
We have partnered with Telstra to provide our customers with a best-in-class Fast & Free Wi-Fi experience. We have invested Telstra Fibre into over 800 of our restaurants.
 
Macca’s Free Wi-Fry is accessible via a Splash Page, this is automatically shown to the customer when they try to connect to Macca’s Free Wi-Fry via their device’s native Wi-Fi settings.
 
Current Wi-Fry® User Experience:
•	Step One: User signs up/in to mymacca’s by entering their mymacca's (MMC) account details.
•	Step Two: User has a connection to Maccas Free Wi-Fry® for 60min or 250mb of data (whichever comes first) daily.
 
Why do we need your help?
Laddering up to our digital objectives, we want to increase Wi-Fry awareness to further drive identity & customer understanding. Increasing usage.
To give everyone a bit of background on the status of our “Maccas Free Wi-Fry®” and the next steps we want to pursue:
 
Phase 1 (Current Status) | MMC sign on to access free Wi-Fi.
 
 
Phase 2 (What we have started to explore) | Enable Salesforce DMP:
 
 
In order to activate this, we will need to discuss the following steps:
•	Publish DMP in Thornleigh HQ LAB to test data.
•	Ensure Salesforce are notified when testing commences so we have relevant resources available to ensure that the data triggers are working. (There is no visible indication from MCD)
•	Look at data to ensure that the triggers are working.
•	Create a timeline for DMP implementation.
 
Phase 3 (needs scoping and exploration) | Enable SFMC:
 
•	Enabling this function will help us fulfil our marketing strategy by:
o	Identify who logs onto to Wi-Fry (ecpID as the identifier)
o	Know the location upon connection
o	Know when the user’s time of connection
o	Be able to reward our customers for connections.
•	Currently need to use the same API call that is used in DMP to gather email addresses in order to set up External ID/ecpID
•	API documentation required from DDB – (Want purple to get ecpid from MMC.)
•	Scope of work to replicate what we did from DMP, but explore how we add additional information (ecpID)
o	Need to develop a timeline next meeting
o	Need to work out all estimates and scope of work
•	Zac to confirm:
o	What is daily expected traffic Purple Wifi will be pushing to Salesforce Marketing cloud based on sign-in use case?
o	To get this data we’d like to get a view on the daily sign-in counts for Purple Wifi.
 
 
Next Steps:
The information above is provided for your context and pre alignment ahead of our kick off meeting. Phase 2 and 3 is only what my current understanding is at this stage. Next week’s kick off will be to discuss the options and technical feasibility to implement this work. 
 
Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any questions or require more information, or pass the invite onto anyone you think should be required. 
 
Look forward to discussing the next phases of Wi-Fi.
 
Cheers, 
LDM

Hey G, 

Thanks for looking into it. I’ll see if I can troubleshoot further with the customer as it may be user error.

The Welcome Offer has nothing to do with CIM and is awarded automatically through OCE when a customer first downloads and signs into the app. There is sometimes a slight delay but usually no more than 5 minutes. 

Cheers,

Hi Airi,
 
I have looked into this and can see that the customer was included in the welcome audience as the GMA Offers Optin flag was FALSE during the time of email send. I can see now that has changed to TRUE as the customer has now downloaded the app.
 
In terms of the offer deployment process for the welcome offer, do you know what is the current process like with CIM and what are the normal delay times with the offer being deployed in app after someone signs into the app for first time? For example, as a test, a while earlier, I just created myself a new account and signed into the app using the new account and noticed that there was a delay of like 10-15 minutes for the welcome offer to actually being deployed in the app after I signed in. I wonder if the customer experienced something similar in terms of the offer deployment being delayed?
 
Was wondering if you are able to check from CIM’s end if the welcome has been deployed for this customer? ECPID is 150764967 and if yes, what was the offer deployment time?
 
Thanks,
G

Hi Tom, 

DE stands for data extension in Marketing cloud terminology. The name of the audience/DE in marketing cloud is ""GMA Customers"". I believe this audience was created by Raymond after we got the request from Jefri in March.

Please let me know if there is anything else we need to look into.

Hi Tom/Jefri,
 
Are you guys using the DE named GMA Customers in SFMC as the suppression list? If yes, we are just filtering the Marketing Customer View based on the GMA OFFERS OPTIN flag to build the audience. This should give you a list of all the accounts that have installed and logged into the app at least once.
 
I can see Maddie’s email account madeleine.shimmen@au.mcd.com is also a part of this audience.
 
As far as I am aware I don’t think anything has been changed from our end on the setup of the audience. @Jefri Rahman, please correct me if I am wrong and if you have asked any of the Cap Team members for any recent changes.

Subject: URGENT - GMA - Welcome Offer audiences
Importance: High
 
Hi both, 
 
You would have worked with us in the past, and recently, on building audiences for the GMA campaign. Whereby we send people without GMA a welcome, introductory offer. We use the audience as a suppression, so if you have GMA you shouldn’t get the offer. 
 
We’re seeing that people with GMA are getting served the offer (i.e. Maddy @ Maccas). 
 
We’re trying to understand how this could be possible. Are you able to share descriptions of the audiences you would have helped build for Jefri?
 
We’ve run ths type of offer in the past without difficulty, so it’s very odd! 
 
I want to know:
•	Are there any potential holes in the audiences in the way they are built
•	Have we done anything different this time, than in the past?
 
Appreciate if you come back to use quickly on this one. 
 
Thanks,
Tom

@Mark and Kedhaar,

See below where Ben has shared details issue with his profile and Push Opt Out state.   

There looks to be an issue here (unrelated to test prod or bluedot testing) that warrants further investigation and analysis given the issue as it stands may also impact regular customers.

It seems that despite different attempts there it has not been possible to get Ben’s profile re-opted back in to receive push messaging in SFMC.

Can you please organise analysis and identify root cause and extent of the issue which is affecting Ben’s profile?

Subject: Ben Colley: SFMC Profile (permanent) Push Opt Out

Hi Renato - hope you’re safe & steering clear from some of the Corona Chaos.

As per last weeks discussion, this is a summary of the issue I've experienced with my own SFMC Profile being permanently Opted Out of Push. 

In the testing I tried to conduct (March 2-6) with the mymacca’s app (RC4), I was successfully able to trigger a Bluedot Zone (verified in the Bluedot dashboard & SFMC DE) but I was never able to receive a Push message on my device. After speaking with Kedhaar, he confirmed the issue was my profile on SFMC was Opted Out of Push. 

Despite number attempts (under Kedhaar’s guidance) we were not able to update my Profile to an Opt In state:

•	We tried using the mymacca’s app on both iOS and Android; RC4 bulls from App Center
•	We tried using the current iOS Production build from the App Store
•	Kedhaar was unable too manually Opt In my user profile; this is the expected SFMC behaviour

At this stage, I’m unsure if this is related to the known SFMC SDK issue or if this is seperate issue. It may also simply be an edge-case with my profile.

Late last week (March 12th), I re-downloaded the mymacca’s app (iOS) prod. build from App Store, approved the Notifications permission but my profile is also still Opted Out - Kedhaar confirmed this today March 16th.

Thanks for the initial investigation, I have received a number of similar complaints this week (see all 3 attached) from customers who are receiving an email telling them they have an offer when they do not. 

We need to get to the bottom of this asap as it’s only a matter of time before someone takes the complaint to Ad Standards Australia and we have to complete a formal investigation and will likely receive a fine. 

Raymond, David and Cali can you please prioritize the investigation of this issue and keep me across progress? 

What we know/questions to answer, 

1.	A customer should only receive an email advertising a bi-weekly offer if they are in the propensity output, or the Registered & Not Ordered 60 Day audience. 
2.	There is a break down somewhere because some customers are getting the email and not the offer. 
3.	The eCP ID’s attached have all complained in close proximity about the same issue so let’s use them as a starting point for trouble shooting. 
4.	If we are only sending email to customers in the propensity output from Annalect, how is it possible they don’t have the offer? 
5.	Robust process moving forward to ensure customers are only sent an EDM if we can confirm they have the offer – this should already be in place obviously but assumption is it’s breaking down somewhere. 

Thanks again and please let me know if I can support in anyway.

Hi Team,

 

In the interests of everyone getting a well-deserved Easter break, can you please review the proposed approach below and let me know what the challenges/flags are for your teams @Koh, Mark and @Richard Bedford?

 

Basically proposing we complete the Tuesday set up a week in advance, and move Friday set up forward a day.

 

Tuesday Cycle (17th April)

 

Annalect complete a model run for Tuesday today
Cap send to CIM overnight
Pol and Max set up Tuesday cycle Wednesday 8th April (tomorrow)
 

Considerations

Change to generic push for Tuesday

Hey Raymond,

I have placed the file in SFTP location “/Export/Annalect/Experian/”. Data in the file has different flags as mentioned by Jefri along with hashed email address and ecp_id.

Will you require anything else before setting up DE once Jefri specifies which flags are to be used?

Subject: Experian Data into MC FTP for DEs

Hey Raymond,

Hope you’re well.

Just a heads up, Khalid will be uploading a file to the MC FTP early next week which will contains flags for each user such as:
-	Age
-	Gender
-	Industry
-	Occupation etc.

These will be based on hashed emails so we can use them to create DEs for email, push etc.

Maddy would like to use two of these flags to send an email out to healthcare workers re. the latest promotion for free coffees for healthcare staff.

Could you let me know what’s involved/required to get this setup on your end?

I’ll provide details of exactly which flags to create a DE for the email send next week.

Thanks,

Can you please help us estimate the contact counts after we do the subscriber key migration and then delete the email key records? Please remember that we cannot delete any email contact records that exist in the MCV for NZ Business Unit.

Basically, the target is for the contact records to go below 11 million. Even after the contact deletion, if the contact records don't go 11 million, we need to start discussing Plan B to work out a way to further decrease the counts. So, we need to know the expected counts asap so that we can plan ahead.

We are going to be launching a $1 Large Fries offer exclusive to GMA to encourage customers to use the app (our only true contactless ordering solution). Conscious things are changing very quickly, so I will keep you updated across the week if anything changes. 
 
A few things we need from you before Friday when we launch 😊 
 
1.	Please can you check you have the $1 Large Fries creative on hand ready to go, this will most likely replace all existing ‘Exclusive Offers’ creative. Note will need to keep the ‘GMA purchase’ exclusion in place so we are not targeting customers who have already redeemed, the offer is 1 per customer per 7 days. 
 
2.	I’d like to create and apply an audience exclusion for this piece of media, to exclude customers who are already receiving push (this is so we can spend on those customers who are not receiving the message via other channels). @'Tran, Raymond' can you please create and supply the ‘receives push’ audience to OMD so they can set up the exclusion? 
 
3.	OMD please come back with a recommendation on the GMA acquisition audience, I’d suggest looking at what we’ve used for the welcome offer audience and building out a recommendation based off that. Could be broad, or high value lookalike if we’re confident in defining ‘high value’ – based on monthly spend not AC as previously discussed. 
 
Let me know if you want to jump on a call and chat through in more detail tomorrow.
 
Thanks,

===============================
This purpose of this card is to capture the work required for the Salesforce Integration to C360 piece in Release 6. 

**Background**
----------------
The downstream systems have been assessed and it has been determined that the external segmentation file output by Salesforce needs to be reworked. The rework will be dictated by the Offer Creation Engine and the Offer Association Service, and what data they need to consume in order to operate successfully. 

**Release 6**
----------------
Salesforce Marketing Cloud will have the external segmentation file schema reworked. The rework revolves around the removal of sub-segmentation, and associating a fixed segment Id to a fixed offer. 

**Canary Release**
----------------
For the canary release to be successful, Salesforce Marketing Cloud will either need to output both the R4 and R6 files in parallel, or the solution and schema will need to change in the interim to handle both releases until R4 is turned off and the schema changed to longer be required to accommodate R4 logic. **Discussion still pending.**

As discussed in our contact remediation meeting earlier this week. We will need to update all SQL queries that reference the data views before we start switching the subscriber keys in the sendable DEs. As currently in these queries, the joins are happening based on email equal to subscriber key. All these SQL queries would need to be updated in a two phased approach:

i) First Phase Update: To Be Done Before switching the subkey in sendable DEs

In this first update, the queries will need to be updated to do a UNION between 2 queries (one existing one which joins on email as subkey and a new query that matches with data views on SFID as skey)

ii) Second Phase Update: To be done Before deleting contact records with email as key

Firstly, the back ups of all the data views need to taken and stored in DEs. After this is done, in the queries, previous references that were querying data views with email joining with sub key will need to be updated to now instead query the relevant back-up DE instead of the data view. This is because all the data view data will be lost when the contact records with email as key will be deleted.",5eaa8fdfb7aeb851ec54595f

Requirements

**(5x EDM activated by McCafe Coffee purchases)**

The purpose of this journey is to encourage new McCafe customers to complete their first 5 coffee purchases through the mymacca’s app. 

**Key Considerations**

•	This journey will run as part of the Tuesday propensity code run, output will be provided on Wednesday morning, offers will be live Thursday of every week alongside standard propensity offers. 

•	The output file will include a new field stating whether a customer has made 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 McCafe coffee purchases which will then identify which EDM module they receive, and which push copy they receive. 

•	Customers receiving a McCafe Onboarding offer will be excluded from receiving a standard propensity push.

•	Customers flagged in the output file as receiving a McCafe Onboarding offer will be served the relevant dynamic module within the weekly propensity EDM, which will show above their propensity offer for that day.

•	If a customer doesn’t redeem their McCafe Onboarding offer, they will automatically drop out of the journey until their next coffee purchase (as long as the next coffee purchase is within 6 months of the first McCafe purchase, if outside this window the journey will start again).

•	The journey counts any order with a McCafe coffee, it does not consider amount of coffees purchased. 

•	When the propensity code run on Friday (for Tuesday deployment) takes place, all customers with a McCafe Onboarding offer will be flagged to prevent them receiving another McCafe coffee offer in the same week. 

**Offers (all valid for 7 Days) **

1107,5eaa8d36f0d3b2246b80aa03,February Games - TMS Integration,"For the Feb promotion there are two gameplay mechanics:
1.	Users play a mini-game once per day to win a guaranteed food prize
2.	User perform a MOAP to unlock the secondary game
a.	In this game users play to gain entries into a weekly sweepstakes

For the second gameplay, iWin will receive the MAOP notification from Salesforce (this action is triggered by mParticle integration in GMA). 

The relevant requirements are as follows: 
                
Rule #1	Access to the Secondary gameplay is MOAP Purchase Necessary.
Rule #2	MOAP notification will come to IWIN from Salesforce and use the existing IWIN to Salesforce real-time integration developed for Monopoly 2019.
Rule #3	A user must already have logged into the Feb 2020 experience in order for IWIN to be able to identify this user. If Salesforce sends an API request for a user not in the IWIN system, this request will fail.
Rule #4	A MOAP purchase = Access to the Secondary game until the following day at 02:59:59am

When IWIN receives notification from Salesforce of a MAOP, IWIN will update a user’s “gamepass” to grant them access to the game.

If a user performs two or more MOAP in a single Secondary gameplay “day” there is no additional benefit to the user. 

Assumptions
•              The Salesforce MOAP data feed is real-time. 
•              Salesforce will not send multiple API requests for a single user within a game “day”.
Rule #5	The Secondary gameplay “day” is defined as being from 03:00:00am to 02:59:59am the following day.

The data we currently plan to send on an hourly basis is as follows:

Login – users logging into Feb game

Field Name	Field Description	Data Type	Example
timestamp	The date and time of the occurance in UTC	datetime	2019-09-05 01:00:36

Potentially looking to start wednesday

One option would be to use the app and then tally the redemptions of the different donation products as per below approach.

1.	Employees login to the app with their work related email address.
2.	Employee donates ($1, $2, $5, $10 – each will have its own product ID) in the following way:
a.	Employee adds donation via in app buttons to their basket and then checks out ion app
b.	Employee uses an offer QR or loyalty QR code and then donates in the same transaction (using the allocated product codes)
3.	Donations are aggregated based on product IDs in TLD associated to staff eCP IDs (accounts eligible for staff 20% discount). 
4.	Transactions with discounts applied to the donation are separated and costed appropriately
5.	Numbers reported back to relevant parties internally

Could you confirm that you would be able to pull together an automated report based on the above to go out daily – should we agree to go ahead??
	Total number of staff	Total unique staff that have donated any amount	Total number of $1 donations received	Total number of $2 donations received	Total number of $5 donations received	Total number of $10 donations received	Total number of $1 donations received (with crew offer applied)	Total number of $2 donations received (with crew offer applied)	Total number of $5 donations received (with crew offer applied)	Total number of $10 donations received (with crew offer applied)

I’ve had a chat with Peter and he has confirmed that he would like those files that will be sent to Salesforce to also be sent to SAS.

The path that these files will take is as follows:  (NB: This differs slightly from Monopoly as it won’t be going through Redshift)

1.	iWIN Generate and encrypt files and send to Salesforce FTP– cadence:  Hourly?
2.	Salesforce move files in a location for GoANywhere to pick-up (similar to what was done in Monopoly)
3.	GoAnywhere pickup files from Salesforce FTP,  decrypt file and move to OA server TRANSIN (Peter to provide exact file path)
4.	Analect to pick up file from OA server and process

Actions based on above:

•	TMS confirm stage files received successfully - Kenneth
•	TMS encrypt files using both Salesforce and iWIN public keys - Kenneth
•	TMS advise schedule for file send - time and how often files will be sent – (Hourly?) - Kenneth
•	TMS advise filename structure – Kenneth
•	TMS share data schema for 2 files - 1 containing login information and the other containing prize wins (users playing chance game and winning food prize). - Kenneth
•	Salesforce to provision a file location where GoAnywhere can pick-up files (similar to what was done for Monopoly) – Mark/Gaurav
•	GoAnywhere pickup files, decrypt files and transfer to OA Server TRANSIN location based on TMS schedule – Daniel
•	Analect leverage files placed by OA Server – Djazia and Peter

An active APNS certificate is required by Apple for third party applications to send messages. Once it expires, your org will not be able to send push notifications through the Marketing Cloud to Apple devices until the certificate is updated.
What action do I need to take?
Provisioning information must be added to your Apple AppCenter. The AppCenter is where MobilePush stores APNS certificates. For more information on the steps your org will need to take to initiate the certificate update, click here.
If your org does not have access to the email address used for the AppCenter account, please submit a support case including the application???s ApplicationID and the new email address that you would like to use. Moving forward, your org should use an email alias (if available) to avoid further issues.
What does this change mean for my org?
If your org would like to continue using the MobilePush application, a new certificate from Apple must be generated for the application and uploaded into your AppCenter account. If your org would no longer like to continue using it, please remove the application from the AppCenter account.
How can I get more information?

NB
For the two journeys above, the offers and segments will need to be created and passed through daily for offer set up until March when the expiry date issue is fixed in CIM – thus it may be worth exploring an automation to facilitate. This needs further discussion with TRACK and CAP, I will arrange a catch up with Mark and Reagon next week to chat through feasibility/approach.

I'm doing testing for the delta queries, and I've come across duplicate customer record pairs that share DCS_ID's:

 

There are 147 effected DCS_IDs in MCV (ignoring the null DCS_ID), and as the R6 stack/downstream systems use DCS_ID as a PK, this will surely cause errors. 
I've checked a handful of these DCS_IDs in service cloud, and the ones I checked do not share the duplicate records. How do we approach this? Do we delete the duplicate records in MC that aren't in SC?

Regards,

Jeremy

General next steps as follows – @Maddy to oversee: 
•	Additional data to salesforce – should this be an update to the existing TLD data extension or new? (Daniel/Jack) Jack would add the visa paid attribute into the offer matrix file
o	Payment type (inc. ePayment) 
o	Card Type (eg. VISA, MC, AMEX etc) 
o	Issuer (eg. ING, St.George bank) o	Unique Transaction ID o	Customer ID 

•	Salesforce to map new data from data warehouse as data extension (CapGem)

 •	Salesforce to setup offer segment to run alongside regular Tuesday & Thursday offers segmentation (Cap Gem) o	1st occurrence of (Card type = VISA & payment type = ePayment) for any customer ID

 •	Airi to work with Pol to setup and deploy $5 off offer

Requirements/Queries

1. new data from Data warehouse to be mapped in a separate DE.

Queries: do we have mapping sheet? Do we need to create new fields?
